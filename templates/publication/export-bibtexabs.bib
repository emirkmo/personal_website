     abstract = "{We present the analysis of SN 2020wnt, an unusual hydrogen-poor
        superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), at a redshift of 0.032. The
        light curves of SN 2020wnt are characterized by an early bump
        lasting \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5 d, followed by a
        bright main peak. The SN reaches a peak absolute magnitude of
        M$_{r}^{\rm max}=-20.52\pm 0.03$ mag at
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde77.5 d from explosion. This
        magnitude is at the lower end of the luminosity distribution of
        SLSNe-I, but the rise-time is one of the longest reported to
        date. Unlike other SLSNe-I, the spectra of SN 2020wnt do not
        show O II, but strong lines of C II and Si II are detected.
        Spectroscopically, SN 2020wnt resembles the Type Ic SN 2007gr,
        but its evolution is significantly slower. Comparing the
        bolometric light curve to hydrodynamical models, we find that SN
        2020wnt luminosity can be explained by radioactive powering. The
        progenitor of SN 2020wnt is likely a massive and extended star
        with a pre-SN mass of 80 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ and a pre-SN
        radius of 15 R$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ that experiences a very
        energetic explosion of 45 {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$ erg,
        producing 4 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ of $^{56}$Ni. In this
        framework, the first peak results from a post-shock cooling
        phase for an extended progenitor, and the luminous main peak is
        due to a large nickel production. These characteristics are
        compatible with the pair-instability SN scenario. We note,
        however, that a significant contribution of interaction with
        circumstellar material cannot be ruled out.}",

        emission associated with an SN at only +34 days past the epoch
        of the B-band maximum. Additional HST images extending through
        +578 days cover the evolution of LE1 taking the form of a ring,

        segments of a new inner LE ring (LE2) as well as two additional
        outer LE rings (LE3 and LE4). Adopting the single-scattering
        formalism, the angular radii of the LEs suggest they originate
        from discrete dust sheets in the foreground of the SN. This
        information, combined with measurements of color and optical
        depth of the scattering surfaces, informs a scenario with
        multiple sheets of clumpy dust characterized by a varying degree
        of holes. In this case, the larger the LE's angular radii, the
        farther in the foreground of the SN its dust sheet is located.
        However, an exception to this is LE2, which is formed by a dust
        sheet located in closer proximity to the SN than the dust sheets
        producing LE1, LE3, and LE4. The delayed appearance of LE2 can
        be attributed to its dust sheet having a significant hole along

        Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI)
        observations, combined with ground-based optical data from the
        South African Large Telescope (SALT), constitute the first
        complete optical $+$ NIR $+$ MIR nebular SN Ia spectrum covering
        0.3$-$14 $\mu$m. This spectrum unveils the previously unobserved
        2.5$-$5 $\mu$m region, revealing strong nebular iron and stable
        nickel emission, indicative of high-density burning that can
        constrain the progenitor mass. The data show a significant
        improvement in sensitivity and resolution compared to previous
        Spitzer MIR data. We identify numerous NIR and MIR nebular
        emission lines from iron-group elements and as well as lines
        from the intermediate-mass element argon. The argon lines extend
        to higher velocities than the iron-group elements, suggesting
        stratified ejecta that are a hallmark of delayed-detonation or
        double-detonation SN Ia models. We present fits to simple
        geometric line profiles to features beyond 1.2 $\mu$m and find
        that most lines are consistent with Gaussian or spherical
        emission distributions, while the [Ar III] 8.99 $\mu$m line has
        a distinctively flat-topped profile indicating a thick spherical
        shell of emission. Using our line profile fits, we investigate
        the emissivity structure of SN 2021aefx and measure kinematic
        properties. Continued observations of SN 2021aefx and other SNe
        Ia with JWST will be transformative to the study of SN Ia
        composition, ionization structure, density, and temperature, and

        envelope (SE) supernovae (SNe), their massive ejecta should lead
        to broad, long-duration lightcurves (LCs). Instead, literature
        samples of SE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeSNe have reported
        relatively narrow LCs with ejecta masses between 1-4 Msun that
        favor progenitors <20-25 Msun. Working with the untargeted
        sample of (i)PTF SNe to better constrain their rates, we search
        for SE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeSNe with broad LCs. Using
        a simple LC stretch compared to a template to measure broadness,
        we identified eight significantly broader
        Type\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeIbc SNe after applying
        quantitative sample selection criteria. The LCs, colors, and
        spectra of these SNe are found to evolve more slowly relative to
        typical Type\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeIbc SNe,
        proportional with the stretch. Bolometric LC modeling and their
        nebular spectra indicate high ejecta and nickel masses, assuming
        radioactive decay powering. Additionally, these objects are
        preferentially located in low-metallicity host galaxies with
        high star-formation rates, which may account for their massive
        progenitors, as well as their relative absence from the
        literature. Our study thus supports the link between broad LCs
        (as measured by stretch) and high-mass progenitor stars in
        SE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeSNe with independent evidence
        from bolometric LC modeling, nebular spectra, host environment
        properties, and photometric evolution. In the first systematic
        search of its kind using an untargeted sample, we use the
        stretch distribution to identify a higher than previously
        appreciated fraction of SE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeSNe
        with broad LCs (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde13\%).
        Correcting for Malmquist and LC duration observational biases,
        we conservatively estimate that a minimum of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde6\% of
        SE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeSNe are consistent with high-
        mass progenitors. This result has implications for the
        progenitor channels of SE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeSNe,
        late stages of massive stellar evolution, oxygen fraction in the
        universe, and formation channels for stellar-mass black

        2017cbv, two Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) on the outskirts of the

        near-infrared (NIR) spectra obtained by the Carnegie Supernova
        Project-II, in addition to previously published optical and NIR
        spectra. By measuring nebular-phase [Fe II] lines in both the
        optical and NIR, we examine the explosion kinematics and test
        the efficacy of several emission line fitting techniques
        commonly used in the literature. The NIR [Fe II] 1.644 $\mu$m
        line provides the most robust velocity measurements against
        variations due to the choice of the fit method and line
        blending. The resulting effects on velocity measurements due to
        choosing different fit methods, initial fit parameters,
        continuum and line profile functions, and fit region boundaries
        were also investigated. The NIR [Fe II] velocities yield the
        same radial shift direction as velocities measured using the
        optical [Fe II] 7155 A line, but the sizes of the shifts are
        consistently and substantially lower, pointing to a potential
        issue in optical studies. The NIR [Fe II] 1.644 $\mu$m emission
        profile shows a lack of significant asymmetry in both SNe Ia,
        and the observed low velocities elevate the importance for
        correcting for any radial velocity contribution from the host
        galaxy's rotation. The low [Fe II] velocities measured in the
        NIR at nebular phases disfavors most progenitor scenarios in
        close double-degenerate systems for both SN 2013aa and SN
        2017cbv. The time evolution of the NIR [Fe II] 1.644 $\mu$m line
        also indicates moderately high progenitor white dwarf central
        density and potentially high magnetic fields. These sibling SNe
        Ia were well observed at both early and late times, providing an
        excellent opportunity to study the intrinsic diversity of SNe
        Ia.}",

        Calibrator peak magnitudes together with Cepheid-based distances
        are used to estimate the average absolute magnitude in each

        intercept of the magnitude-redshift relation. Our baseline
        result of $H_0$ is $72.3\pm1.4$ (stat) $\pm1.4$ (syst) km

        SNe from CSP and CfA programmes, noteworthy because these are
        the best calibrated, yielding $H_0\sim75$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$

        magnitudes. Based on our results, in order to improve the
        precision of the $H_0$ measurement with SNe Ia in the NIR in the
        future, we would need to increase the number of calibrator SNe
        Ia, be able to extend the Hubble-Lema{\^\i}tre diagram to
        higher-z, and include standardization procedures to help
        reducing the NIR intrinsic scatter.}",

     abstract = "{Since the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe more
        than two decades ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have been
        extensively used as standardisable candles in the optical.
        However, SNe Ia have shown to be more homogeneous in the near-
        infrared (NIR), where the effect of dust extinction is also
        attenuated. In this work, we explore the possibility of using a
        low number of NIR observations for accurate distance
        estimations, given the homogeneity at these wavelengths. We
        found that one epoch in J and/or H band, plus good gr-band
        coverage, gives an accurate estimation of peak magnitudes in the
        J (J$_{max}$) and H (H$_{max}$) bands. The use of a single NIR
        epoch only introduces an additional scatter of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.05 mag for epochs around the time of B-band
        peak magnitude (T$_{max}$). We also tested the effect of optical
        cadence and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the estimation of
        T$_{max}$ and its uncertainty propagation to the NIR peak
        magnitudes. Both cadence and S/N have a similar contribution,
        where we constrained the introduced scatter of each to < 0.02
        mag in J$_{max}$ and < 0.01 in H$_{max}$. However, these effects
        are expected to be negligible, provided the data quality is
        comparable to that obtained for observations of nearby SNe (z
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 0.1). The effect of S/N in the NIR was
        tested as well. For SNe Ia at 0.08 < z {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}
        0.1, NIR observations with better S/N than that found in the CSP
        sample is necessary to constrain the introduced scatter to a
        minimum ({\ensuremath{\lesssim}}0.05 mag). These results provide

        luminous red novae (LRNe): AT2018bwo, AT2021afy, and A2021blu.
        AT2018bwo was discovered in NGC45 (at about 6.8 Mpc) a few weeks
        after the outburst onset. During the monitoring period, the
        transient reached a peak luminosity of 10\^40 erg/s. AT2021afy,
        hosted by UGC10043 (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde49.2 Mpc),
        showed a double-peaked light curve, with an early maximum
        reaching a luminosity of 2.1x10\^41 erg/s. Finally, for
        AT2021blu in UGC5829 (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde8.6 Mpc),
        the pre-outburst phase was well-monitored by several photometric
        surveys, and the object showed a slow luminosity rise before the
        outburst. The light curve of AT2021blu was sampled with an
        unprecedented cadence until the object disappeared behind the
        Sun, and was then recovered at late phases. The light curve of
        LRN AT2021blu shows a double peak, with a prominent early
        maximum reaching a luminosity of 6.5x10\^40 erg/s, half that of
        AT2021afy. The spectra of AT2021afy and AT 2021blu display the
        expected evolution for LRNe: a blue continuum dominated by
        prominent Balmer lines in emission during the first peak, and a
        redder continuum consistent with that of a K-type star with
        narrow absorption metal lines during the second, broad maximum.
        The spectra of AT2018bwo are markedly different, with a very red
        continuum dominated by broad molecular features in absorption.
        As these spectra closely resemble those of LRNe after the second
        peak, probably AT 2018bwo was discovered at the very late
        evolutionary stages. This would explain its fast evolution and
        the spectral properties compatible with that of an M-type star.
        From the analysis of deep frames of the LRN sites years before
        the outburst, and considerations of the light curves, the
        quiescent progenitor systems of the three LRNe were likely
        massive, with primaries ranging from about 13Mo for AT2018bwo,
        to 13-18Mo for AT 2021blu, and over 40Mo for AT2021afy.}",

        obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project-II (CSP-II),
        encompassing optical spectroscopic Types IIb, Ib, Ic, and Ic-BL.
        The spectra range in phase from pre-maximum to 80 days past
        maximum. This unique data set constitutes the largest NIR
        spectroscopic sample of SESNe to date. NIR spectroscopy provides
        observables with additional information that is not available in
        the optical. Specifically, the NIR contains the strong lines of
        He I and allows a more detailed look at whether Type Ic
        supernovae are completely stripped of their outer He layer. The
        NIR spectra of SESNe have broad similarities, but closer
        examination through statistical means reveals a strong dichotomy
        between NIR ``He-rich'' and ``He-poor'' SNe. These NIR subgroups
        correspond almost perfectly to the optical IIb/Ib and Ic/Ic-BL
        types, respectively. The largest difference between the two
        groups is observed in the 2 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m region, near the
        He I {\ensuremath{\lambda}}2.0581 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m line. The
        division between the two groups is not an arbitrary one along a
        continuous sequence. Early spectra of He-rich SESNe show much
        stronger He I {\ensuremath{\lambda}}2.0581 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m
        absorption compared to the He-poor group, but with a wide range
        of profile shapes. The same line also provides evidence for
        trace amounts of He in half of our SNe in the He-poor group.

     abstract = "{Context. Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) are a rare class of stripped
        envelope supernovae interacting with a helium-rich circumstellar
        medium (CSM). The majority of the SNe Ibn reported in the
        literature display a surprising homogeneity in their fast-
        evolving lightcurves and are typically found in actively
        starforming spiral galaxies. \textbackslash Aims: We present the
        discovery and the study of SN 2020bqj (ZTF20aalrqbu), a SN Ibn
        with a long-duration peak plateau lasting 40 days and hosted by
        a faint low-mass galaxy. We aim to explain its peculiar
        properties using an extensive photometric and spectroscopic data
        set. \textbackslash Methods: We compare the photometric and
        spectral evolution of SN 2020bqj with regular SNe Ibn from the
        literature, as well as with other outliers in the SN Ibn
        subclass. We fit the bolometric and multi-band lightcurves with
        powering mechanism models such as radioactive decay and CSM
        interaction. We also model the host galaxy of SN 2020bqj.
        \textbackslash Results: The risetime, peak magnitude and
        spectral features of SN 2020bqj are consistent with those of
        most SNe Ibn, but the SN is a clear outlier in the subclass
        based on its bright, long-lasting peak plateau and the low mass
        of its faint host galaxy. We show through modeling that the
        lightcurve of SN 2020bqj can be powered predominantly by shock
        heating from the interaction of the SN ejecta and a dense CSM,
        combined with radioactive decay. The peculiar Type Ibn SN 2011hw
        is a close analog to SN 2020bqj in terms of lightcurve and
        spectral evolution, suggesting a similar progenitor and CSM
        scenario. In this scenario a very massive progenitor star in the
        transitional phase between a luminous blue variable and a
        compact Wolf-Rayet star undergoes core-collapse, embedded in a
        dense helium-rich CSM with an elevated opacity compared to
        normal SNe Ibn, due to the presence of residual hydrogen. This
        scenario is consistent with the observed properties of SN
        2020bqj and the modeling results. \textbackslash Conclusions: SN
        2020bqj is a compelling example of a transitional SN Ibn/IIn
        based on not only its spectral features, but also its
        lightcurve, host galaxy properties and the inferred progenitor
        properties. The strong similarity with SN 2011hw suggests this
        subclass may be the result of a progenitor in a stellar
        evolution phase that is distinct from those of progenitors of
        regular SNe Ibn. \textbackslash\textbackslashSpectra are

        spectroscopically normal Type Ic supernovae, with focus on the
        light curves. The photometric data were obtained over 7 years
        with the Palomar Transient Factory and its continuation, the
        intermediate Palomar Transient Factory. This is the first
        homogeneous and large sample of SNe Ic from an untargeted
        survey, and we aim to estimate explosion parameters for the
        sample. \textbackslash Methods: We present K-corrected Bgriz
        light curves of these SNe, obtained through photometry on
        template-subtracted images. We performed an analysis on the
        shape of the r-band light curves and confirmed the correlation

        magnitudes have an average of {\ensuremath{-}}17.71
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.85 mag. To derive the explosion epochs, we
        fit the r-band lightcurves to a template derived from a well-
        sampled light curve. We computed the bolometric light curves
        using r and g band data, g {\ensuremath{-}} r colors and
        bolometric corrections. Bolometric light curves and Fe II
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}5169 velocities at peak were used to fit
        to the Arnett semianalytic model in order to estimate the ejecta
        mass M$_{ej}$, the explosion energy E$_{K}$ and the mass of
        radioactive nickel M($^{56}$Ni) for each SN. \textbackslash

        distributions are comparable to those available in the

        (M$_{R, peak}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {\ensuremath{-}}19)
        transients interacting with He-rich circumstellar material
        (CSM). SN 2018bcc, detected by the ZTF shortly after explosion,
        provides the best constraints on the shape of the rising light
        curve (LC) of a fast Type Ibn. \textbackslash Aims: We used the
        high-quality data set of SN 2018bcc to study observational
        signatures of the class. Additionally, the powering mechanism of
        SN 2018bcc offers insights into the debated progenitor
        connection of Type Ibn SNe. \textbackslash Methods: We compared
        well-constrained LC properties obtained from empirical models
        with the literature. We fit the pseudo-bolometric LC with semi-
        analytical models powered by radioactive decay and CSM
        interaction. Finally, we modeled the line profiles and
        emissivity of the prominent He I lines, in order to study the
        formation of P-Cygni profiles and to estimate CSM properties.
        \textbackslash Results: SN 2018bcc had a rise time to peak of
        the LC of 5.6$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.1}$$^{+0.2}$ days in the
        restframe with a rising shape power-law index close to 2, and
        seems to be a typical rapidly evolving Type Ibn SN. The spectrum
        lacked signatures of SN-like ejecta and was dominated by over 15
        He emission features at 20 days past peak, alongside Ca and Mg,
        all with V$_{FWHM}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2000 km
        s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$. The luminous and rapidly evolving LC
        could be powered by CSM interaction but not by the decay of
        radioactive $^{56}$Ni. Modeling of the He I lines indicated a
        dense and optically thick CSM that can explain the P-Cygni
        profiles. \textbackslash Conclusions: Like other rapidly
        evolving Type Ibn SNe, SN 2018bcc is a luminous transient with a
        rapid rise to peak powered by shock interaction inside a dense
        and He-rich CSM. Its spectra do not support the existence of two
        Type Ibn spectral classes. We also note the remarkable
        observational match to pulsational pair instability SN models.}",

        novae (LRNe) AT 2020hat in NGC 5068 and AT 2020kog in NGC 6106.
        The two objects were imaged (and detected) before their
        discovery by routine survey operations. They show a general
        trend of slow luminosity rise, lasting at least a few months.
        The subsequent major LRN outbursts were extensively followed in
        photometry and spectroscopy. The light curves present an initial
        short-duration peak, followed by a redder plateau phase. AT
        2020kog is a moderately luminous event peaking at
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}7 {\texttimes} {}10$^{40}$ erg
        s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$, while AT 2020hat is almost one order of
        magnitude fainter than AT 2020kog, although it is still more
        luminous than V838 Mon. In analogy with other LRNe, the spectra
        of AT 2020kog change significantly with time. They resemble
        those of type IIn supernovae at early phases, then they become
        similar to those of K-type stars during the plateau, and to
        M-type stars at very late phases. In contrast, AT 2020hat
        already shows a redder continuum at early epochs, and its
        spectrum shows the late appearance of molecular bands. A
        moderate-resolution spectrum of AT 2020hat taken at +37 d after
        maximum shows a forest of narrow P Cygni lines of metals with
        velocities of 180 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$, along with an
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission with a full-width at half-
        maximum velocity of 250 km s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$. For AT
        2020hat, a robust constraint on its quiescent progenitor is
        provided by archival images of the Hubble Space Telescope. The
        progenitor is clearly detected as a mid-K type star, with an
        absolute magnitude of M$_{F606W}$ = {\ensuremath{-}}3.33
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.09 mag and a colour of F606W
        {\ensuremath{-}} F814W = 1.14 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.05 mag, which
        are inconsistent with the expectations from a massive star that
        could later produce a core-collapse supernova. Although quite
        peculiar, the two objects nicely match the progenitor versus
        light curve absolute magnitude correlations discussed in the
        literature. \textbackslash\textbackslashPhotometric tables are

        <ASTROBJ>AT 2019zhd</ASTROBJ>, the third event of this class
        observed in <ASTROBJ>M 31</ASTROBJ>. The object was followed by
        several sky surveys for about five months before the outburst,
        during which it showed a slow luminosity rise. In this phase,
        the absolute magnitude ranged from M$_{r}$ = -2.8
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.2 mag to M$_{r}$ = -5.6 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.1 mag. Then, over a four to five day period, <ASTROBJ>AT
        2019zhd</ASTROBJ> experienced a major brightening, reaching a
        peak of M$_{r}$ = -9.61 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.08 mag and an
        optical luminosity of 1.4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
        After a fast decline, the light curve settled onto a short-
        duration plateau in the red bands. Although less pronounced,
        this feature is reminiscent of the second red maximum observed
        in other LRNe. This phase was followed by a rapid linear decline
        in all bands. At maximum, the spectra show a blue continuum with
        prominent Balmer emission lines. The post-maximum spectra show a
        much redder continuum, resembling that of an intermediate-type
        star. In this phase, H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} becomes very weak,
        H{\ensuremath{\beta}} is no longer detectable, and a forest of
        narrow absorption metal lines now dominate the spectrum. The
        latest spectra, obtained during the post-plateau decline, show a
        very red continuum (T$_{eff}$ {\ensuremath{\approx}} 3000 K)
        with broad molecular bands of TiO, similar to those of M-type
        stars. The long-lasting, slow photometric rise observed before
        the peak resembles that of LRN <ASTROBJ>V1309 Sco</ASTROBJ>,
        which was interpreted as the signature of the common-envelope
        ejection. The subsequent outburst is likely due to the gas
        outflow following a stellar merging event. The inspection of
        archival HST images taken 22 years before the LRN discovery
        reveals a faint red source (M$_{F555W}$ = 0.21
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.14 mag, with F555W - F814W = 2.96
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.12 mag) at the position of <ASTROBJ>AT
        2019zhd</ASTROBJ>, which is the most likely quiescent precursor.
        The source is consistent with expectations for a binary system
        including a predominant M5-type star.

        their first light than ever before. Applying analytical models
        to such early emission, we can constrain the progenitor stars'
        properties. In this paper, we present observations of SN 2018fif
        (ZTF 18abokyfk). The supernova was discovered close to first
        light and monitored by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and
        the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Early spectroscopic
        observations suggest that the progenitor of SN 2018fif was
        surrounded by relatively small amounts of circumstellar material
        compared to all previous cases. This particularity, coupled with
        the high-cadence multiple-band coverage, makes it a good
        candidate to investigate using shock-cooling models. We employ
        the SOPRANOS code, an implementation of the model by Sapir \&
        Waxman and its extension to early times by Morag et al. Compared
        with previous implementations, SOPRANOS has the advantage of
        including a careful account of the limited temporal validity
        domain of the shock-cooling model as well as allowing usage of
        the entirety of the early UV data. We find that the progenitor
        of SN 2018fif was a large red supergiant with a radius of
        $R={744.0}_{-128.0}^{+183.0}\,{R}_{\odot }$ and an ejected mass
        of ${M}_{\mathrm{ej}}={9.3}_{-5.8}^{+0.4}\,{M}_{\odot }$ . Our
        model also gives information on the explosion epoch, the
        progenitor's inner structure, the shock velocity, and the
        extinction. The distribution of radii is double-peaked, with
        smaller radii corresponding to lower values of the extinction,
        earlier recombination times, and a better match to the early UV
        data. If these correlations persist in future objects, denser
        spectroscopic monitoring constraining the time of recombination,
        as well as accurate UV observations (e.g., with ULTRASAT), will
        help break the extinction/radius degeneracy and independently
        determine both.}",

     abstract = "{The Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) LSQ14fmg exhibits exaggerated properties
        that may help to reveal the origin of the ``super-
        Chandrasekhar'' (or 03fg-like) group. The optical spectrum is
        typical of a 03fg-like SN Ia, but the light curves are unlike
        those of any SNe Ia observed. The light curves of LSQ14fmg rise
        extremely slowly. At -23 rest-frame days relative to B-band
        maximum, LSQ14fmg is already brighter than ${M}_{V}=-19$ mag
        before host extinction correction. The observed color curves
        show a flat evolution from the earliest observation to
        approximately 1 week after maximum. The near-infrared light
        curves peak brighter than -20.5 mag in the J and H bands, far
        more luminous than any 03fg-like SNe Ia with near-infrared
        observations. At 1 month past maximum, the optical light curves
        decline rapidly. The early, slow rise and flat color evolution
        are interpreted to result from an additional excess flux from a
        power source other than the radioactive decay of the synthesized
        $^{56}$Ni. The excess flux matches the interaction with a
        typical superwind of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star in
        density structure, mass-loss rate, and duration. The rapid
        decline starting at around 1 month past B-band maximum may be an
        indication of rapid cooling by active carbon monoxide (CO)
        formation, which requires a low-temperature and high-density
        environment. These peculiarities point to an AGB progenitor near
        the end of its evolution and the core degenerate scenario as the
        likely explosion mechanism for LSQ14fmg. $^{*}$ This paper

        These observations are complemented with data from the CHilean
        Automatic Supernova sEarch, the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey
        of Transient Objects, and from the Backyard Observatory
        Supernova Search. Observational signatures of AT 2014ej reveal
        that it is similar to other members of the gap-transient
        subclass known as luminous red novae (LRNe), including the
        ubiquitous double-hump light curve and spectral properties
        similar to that of LRN SN 2017jfs. A medium-dispersion visual-
        wavelength spectrum of AT 2014ej taken with the Magellan Clay
        telescope exhibits a P Cygni H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} feature
        characterized by a blue velocity at zero intensity of
        {\ensuremath{\approx}}110 km s$^{-1}$ and a P Cygni minimum
        velocity of {\ensuremath{\approx}}70 km s$^{-1}$. We attribute
        this to emission from a circumstellar wind. Inspection of pre-
        outbust Hubble Space Telescope images yields no conclusive
        progenitor detection. In comparison with a sample of LRNe from
        the literature, AT 2014ej lies at the brighter end of the
        luminosity distribution. Comparison of the ultra-violet,
        optical, infrared light curves of well-observed LRNe to common-
        envelope evolution models from the literature indicates that the
        models underpredict the luminosity of the comparison sample at
        all phases and also produce inconsistent timescales of the
        secondary peak. Future efforts to model LRNe should expand upon
        the current parameter space we explore here and therefore may
        consider more massive systems and a wider range of dynamical
        timescales. \textbackslash\textbackslashThis paper includes data

        intermediate-luminosity red transient (ILRT) designated
        SNhunt120, while in a companion paper we examine the luminous
        red novae AT 2014ej. Our data set for SNhunt120 consists of an
        early optical discovery, estimated to be within three days after
        outburst, the subsequent optical and near-infrared broadband
        followup extending over a period of about two months, two visual
        and two near-infrared wavelength spectra, and Spitzer Space
        Telescope observations extending from early (+28 d) to late
        (+1155 d) phases. SNhunt120 resembles other ILRTs such as NGC
        300-2008-OT and SN 2008S, and like these other ILRTs, SNhunt120
        exhibits prevalent mid-infrared emission at both early and late
        phases. From the comparison of SNhunt120 and other ILRTs to
        electron-capture supernova simulations, we find that the current
        models underestimate the explosion kinetic energy and thereby
        produce synthetic light curves that overestimate the luminosity.

        stretch parameters, s$_{BV}$ or s$_{gr}$, and the time of I-band
        primary maximum relative to the B-band ( ${t}_{\max }^{I-B}$ )
        or g-band ( ${t}_{\max }^{I-g}$ ) maximum it is demonstrated
        that 2003fg-like, 1991bg-like, and 2002cx-like SNe Ia can be
        identified readily. In the cases of these extreme SNe Ia, their
        primary I-band maximum occurs after the time of the B- or g-band
        maxima. We suggest that the timing of the I-band maximum can
        reveal the physical state of the SN Ia explosion as it traces:
        (I) the speed of the recombination front of iron group elements
        in the ejecta, (II) the temperature evolution and rate of
        adiabatic cooling in the ejecta and, (III) the presence of
        interaction with a stellar envelope. This photometric sub-typing
        can be used in conjunction with other SNe analysis, such as the
        Branch diagram, to examine the physics and diversity of SNe Ia.
        The results here can also be used to screen out non-Ia SNe from
        cosmological samples that do not have complete spectroscopic
        typing. Finally, as future surveys like that of the Vera C.
        Rubin Observatory (previously referred to as the Large Synoptic

     abstract = "{The evolution of a Type IIn supernova (SN IIn) is governed by the
        interaction between the SN ejecta and a hydrogen-rich
        circumstellar medium. The SNe IIn thus allow us to probe the
        late-time mass-loss history of their progenitor stars. We
        present a sample of SNe IIn from the untargeted, magnitude-
        limited surveys of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and its
        successor, the intermediate PTF (iPTF). To date, statistics on
        SN IIn optical light-curve properties have generally been based
        on small ({\ensuremath{\lesssim}}10 SNe) samples from targeted
        SN surveys. The SNe IIn found and followed by the PTF/iPTF were
        used to select a sample of 42 events with useful constraints on
        the rise times as well as with available post-peak photometry.
        The sample SNe were discovered in 2009-2016 and have at least
        one low-resolution classification spectrum, as well as
        photometry from the P48 and P60 telescopes at Palomar
        Observatory. We study the light-curve properties of these SNe
        IIn using spline fits (for the peak and the declining portion)
        and template matching (for the rising portion). We study the
        peak-magnitude distribution, rise times, decline rates, colour
        evolution, host galaxies, and K-corrections of the SNe in our
        sample. We find that the typical rise times are divided into
        fast and slow risers at 20 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 6 d and 50
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 11 d, respectively. The decline rates are
        possibly divided into two clusters (with slopes 0.013
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.006 mag d$^{-1}$ and 0.040
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.010 mag d$^{-1}$), but this division has
        weak statistical significance. We find no significant
        correlation between the peak luminosity of SNe IIn and their
        rise times, but the more luminous SNe IIn are generally found to
        be more long-lasting. Slowly rising SNe IIn are generally found
        to decline slowly. The SNe in our sample were hosted by galaxies
        of absolute magnitude -22 {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} M$_{g}$
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} -13 mag. The K-corrections at light-
        curve peak of the SNe IIn in our sample are found to be within
        0.2 mag for the observer's frame r-band, for SNe at redshifts z
        < 0.25. By applying K-corrections and also including ostensibly
        ``superluminous'' SNe IIn, we find that the peak magnitudes are
        M$^{r}$$_{peak}$ = -19.18 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.32 mag. We
        conclude that the occurrence of conspicuous light-curve bumps in
        SNe IIn, such as in iPTF13z, are limited to
        1.4$^{+14.6}$$_{-1.0}$ \% of the SNe IIn. We also investigate a
        possible sub-type of SNe IIn with a fast rise to a
        {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}50 d plateau followed by a slow, linear
        decline. \textbackslash\textbackslashFull Table 2 is only

        the LSQgr band. Early spectra of LSQ13ddu showed the presence of
        weak and narrow He I features arising from interaction with
        circumstellar material (CSM). These interaction signatures
        weakened quickly, with broad features consistent with those seen
        in stripped-envelope SNe becoming dominant around two weeks
        after maximum. The narrow He I velocities are consistent with
        the wind velocities of luminous blue variables but its spectra
        lack the typically seen hydrogen features. The fast and bright
        early light curve is inconsistent with radioactive $^{56}$Ni
        powering but can be explained through a combination of CSM
        interaction and an underlying $^{56}$Ni decay component that
        dominates the later time behaviour of LSQ13ddu. Based on the
        strength of the underlying broad features, LSQ13ddu appears
        deficient in He compared to standard SNe Ib.}",

        QUEST Survey and then followed by the Carnegie Supernova Project
        II at its optical and near-IR wavelengths. Our analysis
        indicates that LSQ13abf was discovered within two days of
        explosion and its first {\ensuremath{\approx}}10 days of
        evolution reveal a B-band light curve with an abrupt drop in
        luminosity. Contemporaneously, the V-band light curve exhibits a
        rise towards a first peak and the r- and i-band light curves
        show no early peak. The early light-curve evolution of LSQ13abf
        is reminiscent of the post-explosion cooling phase observed in
        the Type Ib SN 2008D, and the similarity between the two objects
        extends over weeks. Spectroscopically, LSQ13abf also resembles
        SN 2008D, with P Cygni He I features that strengthen over
        several weeks. Spectral energy distributions are constructed
        from the broad-bandphotometry, a UVOIR light curve is
        constructed by fitting black-body (BB) functions, and the
        underlying BB-temperature and BB-radius profiles are estimated.
        Explosion parameters are estimated by simultaneously fitting an
        Arnett model to the UVOIR light curve and the velocity evolution
        derived from spectral features, and an in addition to a post-
        shock breakout cooling model to the first two epochs of the
        bolometric evolution. This combined model suggests an explosion
        energy of 1.27 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.23 {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$
        ergs, in addition to a relatively high ejecta mass of 5.94
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.10 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, a $^{56}$Ni
        mass of 0.16 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.02 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$,
        and a progenitor-star radius of 28.0 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 7.5
        R$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. The ejecta mass suggests the origins
        of LSQ13abf lie with a > 25 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ zero-age-
        main-sequence mass progenitor and its estimated radius is three
        times larger compared to the result obtained from the same
        analysis applied to observations of SN 2008D, and nine times
        larger compared to SN 1999ex. Alternatively, a comparison of
        hydrodynamical simulations of {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}20-25
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ zero-age-main-sequence progenitors
        that evolve to pre-supernova envelope masses of
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}10 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ and

        four broad lined SNe Ic. The peak luminosity and characteristic
        time-scales of the bolometric light curves are calculated, and
        the light curves modelled to derive $^{56}$Ni and ejecta masses
        (M$_{Ni}$ and M$_{ej}$). Additionally, the temperature evolution
        and spectral line velocity curves of each SN are examined.
        Analysis of the [O I] line in the nebular phase of eight SNe
        suggests their progenitors had initial masses <20
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. The bolometric light curve
        properties are examined in combination with those of other SE
        events from the literature. The resulting data set gives the
        M$_{ej}$ distribution for 80 SE-SNe, the largest such sample in
        the literature to date, and shows that SNe Ib have the lowest
        median M$_{ej}$, followed by narrow-lined SNe Ic, H/He-rich SNe,
        broad-lined SNe Ic, and finally gamma-ray burst SNe. SNe Ic-6/7

        explosion, again suggesting M$_{ZAMS}$ <25

        bimodality in the distribution implies <30
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ progenitors and that envelope

        duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We obtained our photometric
        data with the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and its
        continuation, the intermediate PTF (iPTF). This is the first
        large, homogeneous sample of SNe Ic-BL from an untargeted
        survey. Furthermore, given the high observational cadence of
        iPTF, most of these SNe Ic-BL were discovered soon after
        explosion. We present K-corrected Bgriz light curves of these
        SNe, obtained through photometry on template-subtracted images.
        We analyzed the shape of the r-band light curves, finding a
        correlation between the decline parameter
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}m$_{15}$ and the rise parameter
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}m$_{-10}$. We studied the SN colors and,
        based on g - r, we estimated the host-galaxy extinction for each
        event. Peak r-band absolute magnitudes have an average of -18.6
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.5 mag. We fit each r-band light curve with
        that of SN 1998bw (scaled and stretched) to derive the explosion
        epochs. We computed the bolometric light curves using bolometric
        corrections, r-band data, and g - r colors. Expansion velocities
        from Fe II were obtained by fitting spectral templates of SNe
        Ic. Bolometric light curves and velocities at peak were fitted
        using the semianalytic Arnett model to estimate ejecta mass
        M$_{ej}$, explosion energy E$_{K}$ and $^{56}$Ni mass
        M($^{56}$Ni) for each SN. We find average values of M$_{ej}$ = 4

        compared to those presented in the literature and are overall in
        agreement with them. We also estimated the degree of $^{56}$Ni
        mixing using scaling relations derived from hydrodynamical
        models and we find that all the SNe are strongly mixed. The
        derived explosion parameters imply that at least 21\% of the
        progenitors of SNe Ic-BL are compatible with massive (> 28
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$), possibly single stars, whereas at

        broad light curve around maximum light, consistent with massive
        ejecta if we assume a radioactive-powering scenario.
        \textbackslash Aims: We aim to study the late-time light curve
        of iPTF15dtg, which turned out to be extraordinarily luminous
        for a stripped-envelope (SE) SN, and investigate possible
        powering mechanisms. \textbackslash Methods: We compare the
        observed light curves to those of other SE SNe and also to
        models for the $^{56}$Co decay. We analyze and compare the
        spectra to nebular spectra of other SE SNe. We build a
        bolometric light curve and fit it with different models,
        including powering by radioactivity, magnetar powering, and a
        combination of the two. \textbackslash Results: Between 150 and
        750 d post-explosion, the luminosity of iPTF15dtg declined by
        merely two magnitudes instead of the six magnitudes expected
        from $^{56}$Co decay. This is the first spectroscopically
        regular SE SN found to show this behavior. The model with both
        radioactivity and magnetar powering provides the best fit to the
        light curve and appears to be the most realistic powering
        mechanism. An alternative mechanism might be circumstellar-
        medium (CSM) interaction. However, the spectra of iPTF15dtg are
        very similar to those of other SE SNe, and do not show signs of
        strong CSM interaction. \textbackslash Conclusions: The object
        iPTF15dtg is the first spectroscopically regular SE SN whose
        light curve displays such clear signs of a magnetar contributing
        to its late-time powering. Given this result, the mass of the
        ejecta needs to be revised to a lower value, and therefore the
        progenitor mass could be significantly lower than the previously
        estimated > 35 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$.}",

        have similar amounts of He, and that lower mixing could be
        responsible for hiding He in SNe Ic. However, our data
        contradict this mixing hypothesis. The observed difference in
        the expansion rate of the ejecta around maximum light of SNe Ic
        (V$_{m}$ = {\ensuremath{\sqrt{}}}2E$_{k}$/M$_{ej}$
        {\ensuremath{\approx}} 15 000 km s$^{-1}$) and SNe Ib (V$_{m}$
        {\ensuremath{\approx}} 9000 km s$^{-1}$) would imply an average
        He mass difference of {\ensuremath{\sim}}1.4
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, if the other explosion parameters
        are assumed to be unchanged between the SE SN subtypes. We
        conclude that SNe Ic do not hide He but lose He due to envelope
        stripping.}",

        light curves resemble those of SN 2005bf, a peculiar double-
        peaked stripped-envelope (SE) SN, until the declining phase
        after the main peak. We investigate the mechanism powering its
        light curve and the nature of its progenitor star.
        \textbackslash Methods: Optical photometry and spectroscopy of
        PTF11mnb are presented. We compared light curves, colors and
        spectral properties to those of SN 2005bf and normal SE SNe. We
        built a bolometric light curve and modeled this light curve with
        the SuperNova Explosion Code (SNEC) hydrodynamical code
        explosion of a MESA progenitor star and semi-analytic models.
        \textbackslash Results: The light curve of PTF11mnb turns out to
        be similar to that of SN 2005bf until
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde50 d when the main (secondary)
        peaks occur at -18.5 mag. The early peak occurs at
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde20 d and is about 1.0 mag
        fainter. After the main peak, the decline rate of PTF11mnb is
        remarkably slower than what was observed in SN 2005bf, and it
        traces well the $^{56}$Co decay rate. The spectra of PTF11mnb
        reveal a SN Ic and have no traces of He unlike in the case of SN
        Ib 2005bf, although they have velocities comparable to those of
        SN 2005bf. The whole evolution of the bolometric light curve is
        well reproduced by the explosion of a massive (M$_{ej}$ = 7.8
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$), He-poor star characterized by a
        double-peaked $^{56}$Ni distribution, a total $^{56}$Ni mass of
        0.59 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, and an explosion energy of 2.2
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$ erg. Alternatively, a normal SN Ib/c
        explosion (M($^{56}$Ni) = 0.11 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$,
        E$_{K}$ = 0.2 {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$ erg, M$_{ej}$ = 1
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) can power the first peak while a
        magnetar, with a magnetic field characterized by B = 5.0
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{14}$ G, and a rotation period of P = 18.1
        ms, provides energy for the main peak. The early g-band light
        curve can be fit with a shock-breakout cooling tail or an
        extended envelope model from which a radius of at least 30
        R$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ is obtained. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: We presented a scenario where PTF11mnb was the
        explosion of a massive, He-poor star, characterized by a double-
        peaked $^{56}$Ni distribution. In this case, the ejecta mass and
        the absence of He imply a large ZAMS mass
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde85 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$)
        for the progenitor, which most likely was a Wolf-Rayet star,
        surrounded by an extended envelope formed either by a pre-SN
        eruption or due to a binary configuration. Alternatively,
        PTF11mnb could be powered by a SE SN with a less massive
        progenitor during the first peak and by a magnetar afterward.

        Transient Factory (iPTF) 16asu, a luminous, rapidly evolving,
        high-velocity, stripped-envelope supernova (SN). With a rest-
        frame rise time of just four days and a peak absolute magnitude
        of \{M\}$_{\{\{g}$\}\}=-20.4 mag, the light curve of iPTF 16asu
        is faster and more luminous than that of previous rapid

        continuum near peak that develops into an SN Ic-BL spectrum on
        the decline. We show that while the late-time light curve could
        plausibly be powered by $^{56}$Ni decay, the early emission
        requires a different energy source. Nondetections in the X-ray

        collapse explosions of massive stars whose ejecta interact with
        He-rich circumstellar material (CSM). \textbackslash Aims: We
        report the discovery of a SN Ibn, with the longest rise-time
        ever observed, OGLE-2014-SN-131. We discuss the potential
        powering mechanisms and the progenitor nature of this peculiar
        stripped-envelope (SE), circumstellar-interacting SN.
        \textbackslash Methods: Optical photometry and spectroscopy were
        obtained with multiple telescopes including VLT, NTT, and GROND.
        We compare light curves and spectra with those of other known
        SNe Ibn and Ibc. CSM velocities are derived from the spectral
        analysis. The SN light curve is modeled under different
        assumptions about its powering mechanism ($^{56}$Ni decay, CSM-
        interaction, magnetar) in order to estimate the SN progenitor
        parameters. \textbackslash Results: OGLE-2014-SN-131
        spectroscopically resembles SNe Ibn such as SN 2010al. Its peak
        luminosity and post-peak colors are also similar to those of
        other SNe Ibn. However, it shows an unprecedentedly long rise-
        time and a much broader light curve compared to other SNe Ibn.
        Its bolometric light curve can be reproduced by magnetar and
        CSM-interaction models, but not by a $^{56}$Ni-decay powering
        model. \textbackslash Conclusions: To explain the unusually long
        rise-time, the broad light curve, the light curve decline, and
        the spectra characterized by narrow emission lines, we favor a
        powering mechanism where the SN ejecta are interacting with a
        dense CSM. The progenitor of OGLE-2014-SN-131 was likely a Wolf-
        Rayet star with a mass greater than that of a typical SN Ibn
        progenitor, which expelled the CSM that the SN is interacting
        with. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe photometry is available at

        whose spectra are characterized by low-velocity helium emission
        lines with little to no evidence for hydrogen. The prevailing
        theory has been that these are the core-collapse explosions of
        very massive stars embedded in helium-rich circumstellar
        material (CSM). We report optical observations of six new SNe
        Ibn: PTF11rfh, PTF12ldy, iPTF14aki, iPTF15ul, SN 2015G, and
        iPTF15akq. This brings the sample size of such objects in the
        literature to 22. We also report new data, including a near-
        infrared spectrum, on the Type Ibn SN 2015U. In order to
        characterize the class as a whole, we analyze the photometric
        and spectroscopic properties of the full Type Ibn sample. We
        find that, despite the expectation that CSM interaction would
        generate a heterogeneous set of light curves, as seen in SNe
        IIn, most Type Ibn light curves are quite similar in shape,
        declining at rates around 0.1 mag day$^{-1}$ during the first
        month after maximum light, with a few significant exceptions.
        Early spectra of SNe Ibn come in at least two varieties, one
        that shows narrow P Cygni lines and another dominated by broader
        emission lines, both around maximum light, which may be an
        indication of differences in the state of the progenitor system
        at the time of explosion. Alternatively, the spectral diversity
        could arise from viewing-angle effects or merely from a lack of
        early spectroscopic coverage. Together, the relative light curve
        homogeneity and narrow spectral features suggest that the CSM
        consists of a spatially confined shell of helium surrounded by a
        less dense extended wind.}",

     abstract = "{Context. Research on supernovae (SNe) over the past decade has confirmed
        that there is a distinct class of events which are much more
        luminous (by 2 mag) than canonical core-collapse SNe (CCSNe).
        These events with visual peak magnitudes
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}-21 are called superluminous SNe (SLSNe).
        The mechanism that powers the light curves of SLSNe is still not
        well understood. The proposed scenarios are circumstellar
        interaction, the emergence of a magnetar after core collapse, or
        disruption of a massive star through pair production.
        \textbackslash Aims: There are a few intermediate events which
        have luminosities between these two classes. They are important
        for constraining the nature of the progenitors of these two
        different populations and their environments and powering
        mechanisms. Here we study one such object, SN 2012aa.
        \textbackslash Methods: We observed and analysed the evolution
        of the luminous Type Ic SN 2012aa. The event was discovered by
        the Lick Observatory Supernova Search in an anonymous galaxy (z
        {\ensuremath{\approx}} 0.08). The optical photometric and
        spectroscopic follow-up observations were conducted over a time
        span of about 120 days. \textbackslash Results: With an absolute
        V-band peak of - 20 mag, the SN is an intermediate-luminosity
        transient between regular SNe Ibc and SLSNe. SN 2012aa also
        exhibits an unusual secondary bump after the maximum in its
        light curve. For SN 2012aa, we interpret this as a manifestation
        of SN-shock interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). If
        we assume a $^{56}$Ni-powered ejecta, the quasi-bolometric light
        curve requires roughly 1.3 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ of
        $^{56}$Ni and an ejected mass of 14M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$.
        This also implies a high kinetic energy of the explosion, 5.4
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$ erg. On the other hand, the unusually
        broad light curve along with the secondary peak indicate the
        possibility of interaction with CSM. The third alternative is
        the presence of a central engine releasing spin energy that
        eventually powers the light curve over a long time. The host of
        SN 2012aa is a star-forming Sa/Sb/Sbc galaxy. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: Although the spectral properties of SN 2012aa and
        its velocity evolution are comparable to those of normal SNe
        Ibc, its broad light curve along with a large peak luminosity
        distinguish it from canonical CCSNe, suggesting that the event
        is an intermediate-luminosity transient between CCSNe and SLSNe
        at least in terms of peak luminosity. In comparison to other
        SNe, we argue that SN 2012aa belongs to a subclass where CSM
        interaction plays a significant role in powering the SN, at
        least during the initial stages of evolution.}",

     abstract = "{Context. We investigate two stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe)
        discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 5806 by the (intermediate)
        Palomar Transient Factory [(I)PTF]. These SNe, designated
        PTF12os/SN 2012P and iPTF13bvn, exploded within
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde520 days of one another at a
        similar distance from the host-galaxy center. We classify
        PTF12os as a Type IIb SN based on our spectral sequence;
        iPTF13bvn has previously been classified as Type Ib having a
        likely progenitor with zero age main sequence (ZAMS) mass below
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde17 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$.
        Because of the shared and nearby host, we are presented with a
        unique opportunity to compare these two SNe. \textbackslash
        Aims: Our main objective is to constrain the explosion
        parameters of iPTF12os and iPTF13bvn, and to put constraints on
        the SN progenitors. We also aim to spatially map the metallicity
        in the host galaxy, and to investigate the presence of hydrogen
        in early-time spectra of both SNe. \textbackslash Methods: We
        present comprehensive datasets collected on PTF12os and
        iPTF13bvn, and introduce a new automatic reference-subtraction
        photometry pipeline (FPipe) currently in use by the iPTF. We
        perform a detailed study of the light curves (LCs) and spectral
        evolution of the SNe. The bolometric LCs are modeled using the
        hydrodynamical code hyde. We analyze early spectra of both SNe
        to investigate the presence of hydrogen; for iPTF13bvn we also
        investigate the regions of the Paschen lines in infrared
        spectra. We perform spectral line analysis of helium and iron
        lines to map the ejecta structure of both SNe. We use nebular
        models and late-time spectroscopy to constrain the ZAMS mass of
        the progenitors. We also perform image registration of ground-
        based images of PTF12os to archival HST images of NGC 5806 to
        identify a potential progenitor candidate. \textbackslash
        Results: We find that our nebular spectroscopy of iPTF13bvn
        remains consistent with a low-mass progenitor, likely having a
        ZAMS mass of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde12M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$.
        Our late-time spectroscopy of PTF12os is consistent with a ZAMS
        mass of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde15M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. We
        successfully identify a source in pre-explosion HST images
        coincident with PTF12os. The colors and absolute magnitude of
        this object are consistent between pre-explosion and late-time
        HST images, implying it is a cluster of massive stars. Our
        hydrodynamical modeling suggests that the progenitor of PTF12os
        had a compact He core with a mass of 3.25$^{+
        0.77}$$_{-0.56}$M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ at the time of the
        explosion, which had a total kinetic energy of 0.54$^{+
        0.41}$$_{-0.25}$ {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$ erg and synthesized
        0.063$^{+ 0.020}$$_{-0.011}$M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ of
        strongly mixed $^{56}$Ni. Spectral comparisons to the Type IIb
        SN 2011dh indicate that the progenitor of PTF12os was surrounded
        by a thin hydrogen envelope with a mass lower than
        0.02M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. We also find tentative evidence
        that the progenitor of iPTF13bvn could have been surrounded by a
        small amount of hydrogen prior to the explosion. This result is
        supported by possible weak signals of hydrogen in both optical
        and infrared spectra. \textbackslash\textbackslashTables 3-6 are

        (and He-) poor stars, which could either be single Wolf-Rayet
        (WR) stars or lower-mass stars stripped of their envelope by a
        companion. Their light curves are radioactively powered and
        usually show a fast rise to peak
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10-15 d), without any early (in
        the first few days) emission bumps (with the exception of broad-
        lined SNe Ic) as sometimes seen for other types of stripped-
        envelope SNe (e.g., Type IIb SN 1993J and Type Ib SN 2008D).
        \textbackslash Aims: We have studied iPTF15dtg, a
        spectroscopically normal SN Ic with an early excess in the
        optical light curves followed by a long
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30 d) rise to the main peak. It
        is the first spectroscopically-normal double-peaked SN Ic to be
        observed. Our aim is to determine the properties of this
        explosion and of its progenitor star. \textbackslash Methods:
        Optical photometry and spectroscopy of iPTF15dtg was obtained
        with multiple telescopes. The resulting light curves and
        spectral sequence are analyzed and modeled with hydrodynamical
        and analytical models, with particular focus on the early
        emission. \textbackslash Results: iPTF15dtg is a slow rising SN
        Ic, similar to SN 2011bm. Hydrodynamical modeling of the
        bolometric properties reveals a large ejecta mass
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$)
        and strong $^{56}$Ni mixing. The luminous early emission can be
        reproduced if we account for the presence of an extended
        ({\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}500 R$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$), low-mass
        ({\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}0.045 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$)
        envelope around the progenitor star. Alternative scenarios for
        the early peak, such as the interaction with a companion, a
        shock-breakout (SBO) cooling tail from the progenitor surface,
        or a magnetar-driven SBO are not favored. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: The large ejecta mass and the presence of H- and
        He-free extended material around the star suggest that the
        progenitor of iPTF15dtg was a massive ({\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}35
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) WR star that experienced strong mass

        (hereafter V455 And, HS 2331+3905) reveals a rotation period
        shorter than the orbital period, implying the presence of a
        magnetic field. We expect that this magnetic field channels the
        accreted matter from the disk toward the white dwarf poles,
        classifying it as an Intermediate Polar. The two polar spinning

        outburst data reflect a period 4.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2.2
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}s longer than the best-fit post-outburst spin
        period. The angular momentum gained by the white dwarf from
        matter accreted during outburst and its slight subsequent
        shrinking should both cause the star to spin slightly faster
        after the outburst. We estimate that the change in spin period
        due to the outburst should be 5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}s, consistent
        with the empirical determination of 4.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2.2

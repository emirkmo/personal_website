     abstract = "{We present the analysis of SN 2020wnt, an unusual hydrogen-poor
        superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), at a redshift of 0.032. The
        light curves of SN 2020wnt are characterized by an early bump
        lasting \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde5 d, followed by a
        bright main peak. The SN reaches a peak absolute magnitude of
        M$_{r}^{\rm max}=-20.52\pm 0.03$ mag at
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde77.5 d from explosion. This
        magnitude is at the lower end of the luminosity distribution of
        SLSNe-I, but the rise-time is one of the longest reported to
        date. Unlike other SLSNe-I, the spectra of SN 2020wnt do not
        show O II, but strong lines of C II and Si II are detected.
        Spectroscopically, SN 2020wnt resembles the Type Ic SN 2007gr,
        but its evolution is significantly slower. Comparing the
        bolometric light curve to hydrodynamical models, we find that SN
        2020wnt luminosity can be explained by radioactive powering. The
        progenitor of SN 2020wnt is likely a massive and extended star
        with a pre-SN mass of 80 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ and a pre-SN
        radius of 15 R$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ that experiences a very
        energetic explosion of 45 {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$ erg,
        producing 4 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ of $^{56}$Ni. In this
        framework, the first peak results from a post-shock cooling
        phase for an extended progenitor, and the luminous main peak is
        due to a large nickel production. These characteristics are
        compatible with the pair-instability SN scenario. We note,
        however, that a significant contribution of interaction with
        circumstellar material cannot be ruled out.}",

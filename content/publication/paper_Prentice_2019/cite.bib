     abstract = "{We present observations and analysis of 18 stripped-envelope supernovae
        observed during 2013-2018. This sample consists of five H/He-
        rich SNe, six H-poor/He-rich SNe, three narrow lined SNe Ic, and
        four broad lined SNe Ic. The peak luminosity and characteristic
        time-scales of the bolometric light curves are calculated, and
        the light curves modelled to derive $^{56}$Ni and ejecta masses
        (M$_{Ni}$ and M$_{ej}$). Additionally, the temperature evolution
        and spectral line velocity curves of each SN are examined.
        Analysis of the [O I] line in the nebular phase of eight SNe
        suggests their progenitors had initial masses <20
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. The bolometric light curve
        properties are examined in combination with those of other SE
        events from the literature. The resulting data set gives the
        M$_{ej}$ distribution for 80 SE-SNe, the largest such sample in
        the literature to date, and shows that SNe Ib have the lowest
        median M$_{ej}$, followed by narrow-lined SNe Ic, H/He-rich SNe,
        broad-lined SNe Ic, and finally gamma-ray burst SNe. SNe Ic-6/7
        show the largest spread of M$_{ej}$ ranging from
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}1.2-11 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$,
        considerably greater than any other subtype. For all SE-SNe
        <M$_{ej}$> = 2.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.5
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ which further strengthens the
        evidence that SE-SNe arise from low-mass progenitors which are
        typically <5 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ at the time of
        explosion, again suggesting M$_{ZAMS}$ <25
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. The low <M$_{ej}$> and lack of clear
        bimodality in the distribution implies <30
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ progenitors and that envelope
        stripping via binary interaction is the dominant evolutionary
        pathway of these SNe.}",

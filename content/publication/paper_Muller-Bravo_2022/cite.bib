     abstract = "{Since the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe more
        than two decades ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have been
        extensively used as standardisable candles in the optical.
        However, SNe Ia have shown to be more homogeneous in the near-
        infrared (NIR), where the effect of dust extinction is also
        attenuated. In this work, we explore the possibility of using a
        low number of NIR observations for accurate distance
        estimations, given the homogeneity at these wavelengths. We
        found that one epoch in J and/or H band, plus good gr-band
        coverage, gives an accurate estimation of peak magnitudes in the
        J (J$_{max}$) and H (H$_{max}$) bands. The use of a single NIR
        epoch only introduces an additional scatter of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.05 mag for epochs around the time of B-band
        peak magnitude (T$_{max}$). We also tested the effect of optical
        cadence and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the estimation of
        T$_{max}$ and its uncertainty propagation to the NIR peak
        magnitudes. Both cadence and S/N have a similar contribution,
        where we constrained the introduced scatter of each to < 0.02
        mag in J$_{max}$ and < 0.01 in H$_{max}$. However, these effects
        are expected to be negligible, provided the data quality is
        comparable to that obtained for observations of nearby SNe (z
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 0.1). The effect of S/N in the NIR was
        tested as well. For SNe Ia at 0.08 < z {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}
        0.1, NIR observations with better S/N than that found in the CSP
        sample is necessary to constrain the introduced scatter to a
        minimum ({\ensuremath{\lesssim}}0.05 mag). These results provide
        confidence for our FLOWS project that is aimed at using SNe Ia
        with public ZTF optical light curves and few NIR epochs to map
        out the peculiar velocity field of the local Universe. This will
        allow us to determine the distribution of dark matter in our own
        supercluster, Laniakea, and to test the standard cosmological
        model by measuring the growth rate of structures, parameterised
        by fD, and the Hubble-Lema{\^\i}tre constant, H$_{0}$.

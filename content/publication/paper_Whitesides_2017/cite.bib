     abstract = "{Wide-field surveys are discovering a growing number of rare transients
        whose physical origin is not yet well understood. Here we
        present optical and UV data and analysis of intermediate Palomar
        Transient Factory (iPTF) 16asu, a luminous, rapidly evolving,
        high-velocity, stripped-envelope supernova (SN). With a rest-
        frame rise time of just four days and a peak absolute magnitude
        of \{M\}$_{\{\{g}$\}\}=-20.4 mag, the light curve of iPTF 16asu
        is faster and more luminous than that of previous rapid
        transients. The spectra of iPTF 16asu show a featureless blue
        continuum near peak that develops into an SN Ic-BL spectrum on
        the decline. We show that while the late-time light curve could
        plausibly be powered by $^{56}$Ni decay, the early emission
        requires a different energy source. Nondetections in the X-ray
        and radio strongly constrain the energy coupled to relativistic
        ejecta to be at most comparable to the class of low-luminosity
        gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We suggest that the early emission may
        have been powered by either a rapidly spinning-down magnetar or
        by shock breakout in an extended envelope of a very energetic
        explosion. In either scenario a central engine is required,
        making iPTF 16asu an intriguing transition object between
        superluminous SNe, SNe Ic-BL, and low-luminosity GRBs.}",

     abstract = "{\textbackslash Aims: We study PTF11mnb, a He-poor supernova (SN) whose
        light curves resemble those of SN 2005bf, a peculiar double-
        peaked stripped-envelope (SE) SN, until the declining phase
        after the main peak. We investigate the mechanism powering its
        light curve and the nature of its progenitor star.
        \textbackslash Methods: Optical photometry and spectroscopy of
        PTF11mnb are presented. We compared light curves, colors and
        spectral properties to those of SN 2005bf and normal SE SNe. We
        built a bolometric light curve and modeled this light curve with
        the SuperNova Explosion Code (SNEC) hydrodynamical code
        explosion of a MESA progenitor star and semi-analytic models.
        \textbackslash Results: The light curve of PTF11mnb turns out to
        be similar to that of SN 2005bf until
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde50 d when the main (secondary)
        peaks occur at -18.5 mag. The early peak occurs at
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde20 d and is about 1.0 mag
        fainter. After the main peak, the decline rate of PTF11mnb is
        remarkably slower than what was observed in SN 2005bf, and it
        traces well the $^{56}$Co decay rate. The spectra of PTF11mnb
        reveal a SN Ic and have no traces of He unlike in the case of SN
        Ib 2005bf, although they have velocities comparable to those of
        SN 2005bf. The whole evolution of the bolometric light curve is
        well reproduced by the explosion of a massive (M$_{ej}$ = 7.8
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$), He-poor star characterized by a
        double-peaked $^{56}$Ni distribution, a total $^{56}$Ni mass of
        0.59 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, and an explosion energy of 2.2
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$ erg. Alternatively, a normal SN Ib/c
        explosion (M($^{56}$Ni) = 0.11 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$,
        E$_{K}$ = 0.2 {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$ erg, M$_{ej}$ = 1
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) can power the first peak while a
        magnetar, with a magnetic field characterized by B = 5.0
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{14}$ G, and a rotation period of P = 18.1
        ms, provides energy for the main peak. The early g-band light
        curve can be fit with a shock-breakout cooling tail or an
        extended envelope model from which a radius of at least 30
        R$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ is obtained. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: We presented a scenario where PTF11mnb was the
        explosion of a massive, He-poor star, characterized by a double-
        peaked $^{56}$Ni distribution. In this case, the ejecta mass and
        the absence of He imply a large ZAMS mass
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde85 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$)
        for the progenitor, which most likely was a Wolf-Rayet star,
        surrounded by an extended envelope formed either by a pre-SN
        eruption or due to a binary configuration. Alternatively,
        PTF11mnb could be powered by a SE SN with a less massive
        progenitor during the first peak and by a magnetar afterward.

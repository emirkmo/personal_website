     abstract = "{High-cadence transient surveys are able to capture supernovae closer to
        their first light than ever before. Applying analytical models
        to such early emission, we can constrain the progenitor stars'
        properties. In this paper, we present observations of SN 2018fif
        (ZTF 18abokyfk). The supernova was discovered close to first
        light and monitored by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and
        the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Early spectroscopic
        observations suggest that the progenitor of SN 2018fif was
        surrounded by relatively small amounts of circumstellar material
        compared to all previous cases. This particularity, coupled with
        the high-cadence multiple-band coverage, makes it a good
        candidate to investigate using shock-cooling models. We employ
        the SOPRANOS code, an implementation of the model by Sapir \&
        Waxman and its extension to early times by Morag et al. Compared
        with previous implementations, SOPRANOS has the advantage of
        including a careful account of the limited temporal validity
        domain of the shock-cooling model as well as allowing usage of
        the entirety of the early UV data. We find that the progenitor
        of SN 2018fif was a large red supergiant with a radius of
        $R={744.0}_{-128.0}^{+183.0}\,{R}_{\odot }$ and an ejected mass
        of ${M}_{\mathrm{ej}}={9.3}_{-5.8}^{+0.4}\,{M}_{\odot }$ . Our
        model also gives information on the explosion epoch, the
        progenitor's inner structure, the shock velocity, and the
        extinction. The distribution of radii is double-peaked, with
        smaller radii corresponding to lower values of the extinction,
        earlier recombination times, and a better match to the early UV
        data. If these correlations persist in future objects, denser
        spectroscopic monitoring constraining the time of recombination,
        as well as accurate UV observations (e.g., with ULTRASAT), will
        help break the extinction/radius degeneracy and independently
        determine both.}",

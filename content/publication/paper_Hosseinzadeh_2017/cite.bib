     abstract = "{Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are a small yet intriguing class of explosions
        whose spectra are characterized by low-velocity helium emission
        lines with little to no evidence for hydrogen. The prevailing
        theory has been that these are the core-collapse explosions of
        very massive stars embedded in helium-rich circumstellar
        material (CSM). We report optical observations of six new SNe
        Ibn: PTF11rfh, PTF12ldy, iPTF14aki, iPTF15ul, SN 2015G, and
        iPTF15akq. This brings the sample size of such objects in the
        literature to 22. We also report new data, including a near-
        infrared spectrum, on the Type Ibn SN 2015U. In order to
        characterize the class as a whole, we analyze the photometric
        and spectroscopic properties of the full Type Ibn sample. We
        find that, despite the expectation that CSM interaction would
        generate a heterogeneous set of light curves, as seen in SNe
        IIn, most Type Ibn light curves are quite similar in shape,
        declining at rates around 0.1 mag day$^{-1}$ during the first
        month after maximum light, with a few significant exceptions.
        Early spectra of SNe Ibn come in at least two varieties, one
        that shows narrow P Cygni lines and another dominated by broader
        emission lines, both around maximum light, which may be an
        indication of differences in the state of the progenitor system
        at the time of explosion. Alternatively, the spectral diversity
        could arise from viewing-angle effects or merely from a lack of
        early spectroscopic coverage. Together, the relative light curve
        homogeneity and narrow spectral features suggest that the CSM
        consists of a spatially confined shell of helium surrounded by a
        less dense extended wind.}",

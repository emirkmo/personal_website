     abstract = "{Context. The transient iPTF15dtg is a type-Ic supernova (SN) showing a
        broad light curve around maximum light, consistent with massive
        ejecta if we assume a radioactive-powering scenario.
        \textbackslash Aims: We aim to study the late-time light curve
        of iPTF15dtg, which turned out to be extraordinarily luminous
        for a stripped-envelope (SE) SN, and investigate possible
        powering mechanisms. \textbackslash Methods: We compare the
        observed light curves to those of other SE SNe and also to
        models for the $^{56}$Co decay. We analyze and compare the
        spectra to nebular spectra of other SE SNe. We build a
        bolometric light curve and fit it with different models,
        including powering by radioactivity, magnetar powering, and a
        combination of the two. \textbackslash Results: Between 150 and
        750 d post-explosion, the luminosity of iPTF15dtg declined by
        merely two magnitudes instead of the six magnitudes expected
        from $^{56}$Co decay. This is the first spectroscopically
        regular SE SN found to show this behavior. The model with both
        radioactivity and magnetar powering provides the best fit to the
        light curve and appears to be the most realistic powering
        mechanism. An alternative mechanism might be circumstellar-
        medium (CSM) interaction. However, the spectra of iPTF15dtg are
        very similar to those of other SE SNe, and do not show signs of
        strong CSM interaction. \textbackslash Conclusions: The object
        iPTF15dtg is the first spectroscopically regular SE SN whose
        light curve displays such clear signs of a magnetar contributing
        to its late-time powering. Given this result, the mass of the
        ejecta needs to be revised to a lower value, and therefore the
        progenitor mass could be significantly lower than the previously
        estimated > 35 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$.}",

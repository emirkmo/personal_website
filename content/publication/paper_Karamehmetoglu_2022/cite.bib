     abstract = "{If high-mass stars (>20-25 Msun) are the progenitors of stripped-
        envelope (SE) supernovae (SNe), their massive ejecta should lead
        to broad, long-duration lightcurves (LCs). Instead, literature
        samples of SE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeSNe have reported
        relatively narrow LCs with ejecta masses between 1-4 Msun that
        favor progenitors <20-25 Msun. Working with the untargeted
        sample of (i)PTF SNe to better constrain their rates, we search
        for SE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeSNe with broad LCs. Using
        a simple LC stretch compared to a template to measure broadness,
        we identified eight significantly broader
        Type\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeIbc SNe after applying
        quantitative sample selection criteria. The LCs, colors, and
        spectra of these SNe are found to evolve more slowly relative to
        typical Type\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeIbc SNe,
        proportional with the stretch. Bolometric LC modeling and their
        nebular spectra indicate high ejecta and nickel masses, assuming
        radioactive decay powering. Additionally, these objects are
        preferentially located in low-metallicity host galaxies with
        high star-formation rates, which may account for their massive
        progenitors, as well as their relative absence from the
        literature. Our study thus supports the link between broad LCs
        (as measured by stretch) and high-mass progenitor stars in
        SE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeSNe with independent evidence
        from bolometric LC modeling, nebular spectra, host environment
        properties, and photometric evolution. In the first systematic
        search of its kind using an untargeted sample, we use the
        stretch distribution to identify a higher than previously
        appreciated fraction of SE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeSNe
        with broad LCs (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde13\%).
        Correcting for Malmquist and LC duration observational biases,
        we conservatively estimate that a minimum of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde6\% of
        SE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeSNe are consistent with high-
        mass progenitors. This result has implications for the
        progenitor channels of SE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeSNe,
        late stages of massive stellar evolution, oxygen fraction in the
        universe, and formation channels for stellar-mass black
        holes.(Abridged)}",

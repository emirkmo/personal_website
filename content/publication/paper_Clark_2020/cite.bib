     abstract = "{This paper describes the rapidly evolving and unusual supernova
        LSQ13ddu, discovered by the La Silla-QUEST survey. LSQ13ddu
        displayed a rapid rise of just 4.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.9 d to
        reach a peak brightness of -19.70 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.02 mag in
        the LSQgr band. Early spectra of LSQ13ddu showed the presence of
        weak and narrow He I features arising from interaction with
        circumstellar material (CSM). These interaction signatures
        weakened quickly, with broad features consistent with those seen
        in stripped-envelope SNe becoming dominant around two weeks
        after maximum. The narrow He I velocities are consistent with
        the wind velocities of luminous blue variables but its spectra
        lack the typically seen hydrogen features. The fast and bright
        early light curve is inconsistent with radioactive $^{56}$Ni
        powering but can be explained through a combination of CSM
        interaction and an underlying $^{56}$Ni decay component that
        dominates the later time behaviour of LSQ13ddu. Based on the
        strength of the underlying broad features, LSQ13ddu appears
        deficient in He compared to standard SNe Ib.}",

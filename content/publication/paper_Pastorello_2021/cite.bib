     abstract = "{We present the follow-up campaign of the luminous red nova (LRN)
        <ASTROBJ>AT 2019zhd</ASTROBJ>, the third event of this class
        observed in <ASTROBJ>M 31</ASTROBJ>. The object was followed by
        several sky surveys for about five months before the outburst,
        during which it showed a slow luminosity rise. In this phase,
        the absolute magnitude ranged from M$_{r}$ = -2.8
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.2 mag to M$_{r}$ = -5.6 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.1 mag. Then, over a four to five day period, <ASTROBJ>AT
        2019zhd</ASTROBJ> experienced a major brightening, reaching a
        peak of M$_{r}$ = -9.61 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.08 mag and an
        optical luminosity of 1.4 {\texttimes} {}10$^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
        After a fast decline, the light curve settled onto a short-
        duration plateau in the red bands. Although less pronounced,
        this feature is reminiscent of the second red maximum observed
        in other LRNe. This phase was followed by a rapid linear decline
        in all bands. At maximum, the spectra show a blue continuum with
        prominent Balmer emission lines. The post-maximum spectra show a
        much redder continuum, resembling that of an intermediate-type
        star. In this phase, H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} becomes very weak,
        H{\ensuremath{\beta}} is no longer detectable, and a forest of
        narrow absorption metal lines now dominate the spectrum. The
        latest spectra, obtained during the post-plateau decline, show a
        very red continuum (T$_{eff}$ {\ensuremath{\approx}} 3000 K)
        with broad molecular bands of TiO, similar to those of M-type
        stars. The long-lasting, slow photometric rise observed before
        the peak resembles that of LRN <ASTROBJ>V1309 Sco</ASTROBJ>,
        which was interpreted as the signature of the common-envelope
        ejection. The subsequent outburst is likely due to the gas
        outflow following a stellar merging event. The inspection of
        archival HST images taken 22 years before the LRN discovery
        reveals a faint red source (M$_{F555W}$ = 0.21
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.14 mag, with F555W - F814W = 2.96
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.12 mag) at the position of <ASTROBJ>AT
        2019zhd</ASTROBJ>, which is the most likely quiescent precursor.
        The source is consistent with expectations for a binary system
        including a predominant M5-type star.

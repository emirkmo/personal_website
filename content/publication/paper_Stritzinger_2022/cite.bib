     abstract = "{We present a multiband sequence of Hubble Space Telescope images
        documenting the emergence and evolution of multiple light echoes
        (LEs) linked to the stripped-envelope supernova (SN) 2016adj
        located in the central dust lane of Centaurus A. Following
        point-spread function subtraction, we identify the earliest LE
        emission associated with an SN at only +34 days past the epoch
        of the B-band maximum. Additional HST images extending through
        +578 days cover the evolution of LE1 taking the form of a ring,
        while images taken on +1991 days reveal not only LE1 but also
        segments of a new inner LE ring (LE2) as well as two additional
        outer LE rings (LE3 and LE4). Adopting the single-scattering
        formalism, the angular radii of the LEs suggest they originate
        from discrete dust sheets in the foreground of the SN. This
        information, combined with measurements of color and optical
        depth of the scattering surfaces, informs a scenario with
        multiple sheets of clumpy dust characterized by a varying degree
        of holes. In this case, the larger the LE's angular radii, the
        farther in the foreground of the SN its dust sheet is located.
        However, an exception to this is LE2, which is formed by a dust
        sheet located in closer proximity to the SN than the dust sheets
        producing LE1, LE3, and LE4. The delayed appearance of LE2 can
        be attributed to its dust sheet having a significant hole along
        the line of sight between the SN and Earth.}",

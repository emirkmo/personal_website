     abstract = "{Context. Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic) arise from the core-collapse of H-
        (and He-) poor stars, which could either be single Wolf-Rayet
        (WR) stars or lower-mass stars stripped of their envelope by a
        companion. Their light curves are radioactively powered and
        usually show a fast rise to peak
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10-15 d), without any early (in
        the first few days) emission bumps (with the exception of broad-
        lined SNe Ic) as sometimes seen for other types of stripped-
        envelope SNe (e.g., Type IIb SN 1993J and Type Ib SN 2008D).
        \textbackslash Aims: We have studied iPTF15dtg, a
        spectroscopically normal SN Ic with an early excess in the
        optical light curves followed by a long
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30 d) rise to the main peak. It
        is the first spectroscopically-normal double-peaked SN Ic to be
        observed. Our aim is to determine the properties of this
        explosion and of its progenitor star. \textbackslash Methods:
        Optical photometry and spectroscopy of iPTF15dtg was obtained
        with multiple telescopes. The resulting light curves and
        spectral sequence are analyzed and modeled with hydrodynamical
        and analytical models, with particular focus on the early
        emission. \textbackslash Results: iPTF15dtg is a slow rising SN
        Ic, similar to SN 2011bm. Hydrodynamical modeling of the
        bolometric properties reveals a large ejecta mass
        (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$)
        and strong $^{56}$Ni mixing. The luminous early emission can be
        reproduced if we account for the presence of an extended
        ({\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}500 R$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$), low-mass
        ({\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}0.045 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$)
        envelope around the progenitor star. Alternative scenarios for
        the early peak, such as the interaction with a companion, a
        shock-breakout (SBO) cooling tail from the progenitor surface,
        or a magnetar-driven SBO are not favored. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: The large ejecta mass and the presence of H- and
        He-free extended material around the star suggest that the
        progenitor of iPTF15dtg was a massive ({\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}35
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) WR star that experienced strong mass
        loss.}",

     abstract = "{We present multi-wavelength time-series spectroscopy of SN 2013aa and SN
        2017cbv, two Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) on the outskirts of the
        same host galaxy, NGC 5643. This work utilizes new nebular-phase
        near-infrared (NIR) spectra obtained by the Carnegie Supernova
        Project-II, in addition to previously published optical and NIR
        spectra. By measuring nebular-phase [Fe II] lines in both the
        optical and NIR, we examine the explosion kinematics and test
        the efficacy of several emission line fitting techniques
        commonly used in the literature. The NIR [Fe II] 1.644 $\mu$m
        line provides the most robust velocity measurements against
        variations due to the choice of the fit method and line
        blending. The resulting effects on velocity measurements due to
        choosing different fit methods, initial fit parameters,
        continuum and line profile functions, and fit region boundaries
        were also investigated. The NIR [Fe II] velocities yield the
        same radial shift direction as velocities measured using the
        optical [Fe II] 7155 A line, but the sizes of the shifts are
        consistently and substantially lower, pointing to a potential
        issue in optical studies. The NIR [Fe II] 1.644 $\mu$m emission
        profile shows a lack of significant asymmetry in both SNe Ia,
        and the observed low velocities elevate the importance for
        correcting for any radial velocity contribution from the host
        galaxy's rotation. The low [Fe II] velocities measured in the
        NIR at nebular phases disfavors most progenitor scenarios in
        close double-degenerate systems for both SN 2013aa and SN
        2017cbv. The time evolution of the NIR [Fe II] 1.644 $\mu$m line
        also indicates moderately high progenitor white dwarf central
        density and potentially high magnetic fields. These sibling SNe
        Ia were well observed at both early and late times, providing an
        excellent opportunity to study the intrinsic diversity of SNe
        Ia.}",

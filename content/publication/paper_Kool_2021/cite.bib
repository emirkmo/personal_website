     abstract = "{Context. Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) are a rare class of stripped
        envelope supernovae interacting with a helium-rich circumstellar
        medium (CSM). The majority of the SNe Ibn reported in the
        literature display a surprising homogeneity in their fast-
        evolving lightcurves and are typically found in actively
        starforming spiral galaxies. \textbackslash Aims: We present the
        discovery and the study of SN 2020bqj (ZTF20aalrqbu), a SN Ibn
        with a long-duration peak plateau lasting 40 days and hosted by
        a faint low-mass galaxy. We aim to explain its peculiar
        properties using an extensive photometric and spectroscopic data
        set. \textbackslash Methods: We compare the photometric and
        spectral evolution of SN 2020bqj with regular SNe Ibn from the
        literature, as well as with other outliers in the SN Ibn
        subclass. We fit the bolometric and multi-band lightcurves with
        powering mechanism models such as radioactive decay and CSM
        interaction. We also model the host galaxy of SN 2020bqj.
        \textbackslash Results: The risetime, peak magnitude and
        spectral features of SN 2020bqj are consistent with those of
        most SNe Ibn, but the SN is a clear outlier in the subclass
        based on its bright, long-lasting peak plateau and the low mass
        of its faint host galaxy. We show through modeling that the
        lightcurve of SN 2020bqj can be powered predominantly by shock
        heating from the interaction of the SN ejecta and a dense CSM,
        combined with radioactive decay. The peculiar Type Ibn SN 2011hw
        is a close analog to SN 2020bqj in terms of lightcurve and
        spectral evolution, suggesting a similar progenitor and CSM
        scenario. In this scenario a very massive progenitor star in the
        transitional phase between a luminous blue variable and a
        compact Wolf-Rayet star undergoes core-collapse, embedded in a
        dense helium-rich CSM with an elevated opacity compared to
        normal SNe Ibn, due to the presence of residual hydrogen. This
        scenario is consistent with the observed properties of SN
        2020bqj and the modeling results. \textbackslash Conclusions: SN
        2020bqj is a compelling example of a transitional SN Ibn/IIn
        based on not only its spectral features, but also its
        lightcurve, host galaxy properties and the inferred progenitor
        properties. The strong similarity with SN 2011hw suggests this
        subclass may be the result of a progenitor in a stellar
        evolution phase that is distinct from those of progenitors of
        regular SNe Ibn. \textbackslash\textbackslashSpectra are

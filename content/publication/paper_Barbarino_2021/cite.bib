     abstract = "{Context. Type Ic supernovae represent the explosions of the most
        stripped massive stars, but their progenitors and explosion
        mechanisms remain unclear. Larger samples of observed supernovae
        can help characterize the population of these transients.
        \textbackslash Aims: We present an analysis of 44
        spectroscopically normal Type Ic supernovae, with focus on the
        light curves. The photometric data were obtained over 7 years
        with the Palomar Transient Factory and its continuation, the
        intermediate Palomar Transient Factory. This is the first
        homogeneous and large sample of SNe Ic from an untargeted
        survey, and we aim to estimate explosion parameters for the
        sample. \textbackslash Methods: We present K-corrected Bgriz
        light curves of these SNe, obtained through photometry on
        template-subtracted images. We performed an analysis on the
        shape of the r-band light curves and confirmed the correlation
        between the rise parameter
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}m$_{{\ensuremath{-}}10}$ and the decline
        parameter {\ensuremath{\Delta}}m$_{15}$. Peak r-band absolute
        magnitudes have an average of {\ensuremath{-}}17.71
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.85 mag. To derive the explosion epochs, we
        fit the r-band lightcurves to a template derived from a well-
        sampled light curve. We computed the bolometric light curves
        using r and g band data, g {\ensuremath{-}} r colors and
        bolometric corrections. Bolometric light curves and Fe II
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}5169 velocities at peak were used to fit
        to the Arnett semianalytic model in order to estimate the ejecta
        mass M$_{ej}$, the explosion energy E$_{K}$ and the mass of
        radioactive nickel M($^{56}$Ni) for each SN. \textbackslash
        Results: Including 41 SNe, we find average values of ⟨M$_{ej}$⟩
        = 4.50 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.79 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$,
        ⟨E$_{K}$⟩ = 1.79 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.29 {\texttimes}
        {}10$^{51}$ erg, and ⟨M$_{$^{56}$Ni}$⟩ = 0.19 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.03 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. The explosion-parameter
        distributions are comparable to those available in the
        literature, but our large sample also includes some transients
        with narrow and very broad light curves leading to more extreme
        ejecta masses values. \textbackslash\textbackslashLight curves

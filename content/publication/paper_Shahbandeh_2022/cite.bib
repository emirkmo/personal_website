     abstract = "{We present 75 near-infrared (NIR; 0.8-2.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) spectra
        of 34 stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SESNe)
        obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project-II (CSP-II),
        encompassing optical spectroscopic Types IIb, Ib, Ic, and Ic-BL.
        The spectra range in phase from pre-maximum to 80 days past
        maximum. This unique data set constitutes the largest NIR
        spectroscopic sample of SESNe to date. NIR spectroscopy provides
        observables with additional information that is not available in
        the optical. Specifically, the NIR contains the strong lines of
        He I and allows a more detailed look at whether Type Ic
        supernovae are completely stripped of their outer He layer. The
        NIR spectra of SESNe have broad similarities, but closer
        examination through statistical means reveals a strong dichotomy
        between NIR ``He-rich'' and ``He-poor'' SNe. These NIR subgroups
        correspond almost perfectly to the optical IIb/Ib and Ic/Ic-BL
        types, respectively. The largest difference between the two
        groups is observed in the 2 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m region, near the
        He I {\ensuremath{\lambda}}2.0581 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m line. The
        division between the two groups is not an arbitrary one along a
        continuous sequence. Early spectra of He-rich SESNe show much
        stronger He I {\ensuremath{\lambda}}2.0581 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m
        absorption compared to the He-poor group, but with a wide range
        of profile shapes. The same line also provides evidence for
        trace amounts of He in half of our SNe in the He-poor group.

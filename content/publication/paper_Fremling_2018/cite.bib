     abstract = "{We present an analysis of 507 spectra of 173 stripped-envelope (SE)
        supernovae (SNe) discovered by the untargeted Palomar Transient
        Factory (PTF) and intermediate PTF (iPTF) surveys. Our sample
        contains 55 Type IIb SNe (SNe IIb), 45 Type Ib SNe (SNe Ib), 56
        Type Ic SNe (SNe Ic), and 17 Type Ib/c SNe (SNe Ib/c). We have
        compared the SE SN subtypes via measurements of the pseudo-
        equivalent widths (pEWs) and velocities of the He I
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}{\ensuremath{\lambda}}5876, 7065 and O I
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}7774 absorption lines. Consistent with
        previous work, we find that SNe Ic show higher pEWs and
        velocities in O I {\ensuremath{\lambda}}7774 compared to SNe IIb
        and Ib. The pEWs of the He I
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}{\ensuremath{\lambda}}5876, 7065 lines are
        similar in SNe Ib and IIb after maximum light. The He I
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}{\ensuremath{\lambda}}5876, 7065
        velocities at maximum light are higher in SNe Ib compared to SNe
        IIb. We identify an anticorrelation between the He I
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}7065 pEW and O I
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}7774 velocity among SNe IIb and Ib. This
        can be interpreted as a continuum in the amount of He present at
        the time of explosion. It has been suggested that SNe Ib and Ic
        have similar amounts of He, and that lower mixing could be
        responsible for hiding He in SNe Ic. However, our data
        contradict this mixing hypothesis. The observed difference in
        the expansion rate of the ejecta around maximum light of SNe Ic
        (V$_{m}$ = {\ensuremath{\sqrt{}}}2E$_{k}$/M$_{ej}$
        {\ensuremath{\approx}} 15 000 km s$^{-1}$) and SNe Ib (V$_{m}$
        {\ensuremath{\approx}} 9000 km s$^{-1}$) would imply an average
        He mass difference of {\ensuremath{\sim}}1.4
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, if the other explosion parameters
        are assumed to be unchanged between the SE SN subtypes. We
        conclude that SNe Ic do not hide He but lose He due to envelope
        stripping.}",

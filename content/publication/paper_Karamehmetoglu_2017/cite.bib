     abstract = "{Context. Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) are thought to be the core-
        collapse explosions of massive stars whose ejecta interact with
        He-rich circumstellar material (CSM). \textbackslash Aims: We
        report the discovery of a SN Ibn, with the longest rise-time
        ever observed, OGLE-2014-SN-131. We discuss the potential
        powering mechanisms and the progenitor nature of this peculiar
        stripped-envelope (SE), circumstellar-interacting SN.
        \textbackslash Methods: Optical photometry and spectroscopy were
        obtained with multiple telescopes including VLT, NTT, and GROND.
        We compare light curves and spectra with those of other known
        SNe Ibn and Ibc. CSM velocities are derived from the spectral
        analysis. The SN light curve is modeled under different
        assumptions about its powering mechanism ($^{56}$Ni decay, CSM-
        interaction, magnetar) in order to estimate the SN progenitor
        parameters. \textbackslash Results: OGLE-2014-SN-131
        spectroscopically resembles SNe Ibn such as SN 2010al. Its peak
        luminosity and post-peak colors are also similar to those of
        other SNe Ibn. However, it shows an unprecedentedly long rise-
        time and a much broader light curve compared to other SNe Ibn.
        Its bolometric light curve can be reproduced by magnetar and
        CSM-interaction models, but not by a $^{56}$Ni-decay powering
        model. \textbackslash Conclusions: To explain the unusually long
        rise-time, the broad light curve, the light curve decline, and
        the spectra characterized by narrow emission lines, we favor a
        powering mechanism where the SN ejecta are interacting with a
        dense CSM. The progenitor of OGLE-2014-SN-131 was likely a Wolf-
        Rayet star with a mass greater than that of a typical SN Ibn
        progenitor, which expelled the CSM that the SN is interacting
        with. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe photometry is available at

     abstract = "{Context. Supernovae (SNe) Type Ibn are rapidly evolving and bright
        (M$_{R, peak}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} {\ensuremath{-}}19)
        transients interacting with He-rich circumstellar material
        (CSM). SN 2018bcc, detected by the ZTF shortly after explosion,
        provides the best constraints on the shape of the rising light
        curve (LC) of a fast Type Ibn. \textbackslash Aims: We used the
        high-quality data set of SN 2018bcc to study observational
        signatures of the class. Additionally, the powering mechanism of
        SN 2018bcc offers insights into the debated progenitor
        connection of Type Ibn SNe. \textbackslash Methods: We compared
        well-constrained LC properties obtained from empirical models
        with the literature. We fit the pseudo-bolometric LC with semi-
        analytical models powered by radioactive decay and CSM
        interaction. Finally, we modeled the line profiles and
        emissivity of the prominent He I lines, in order to study the
        formation of P-Cygni profiles and to estimate CSM properties.
        \textbackslash Results: SN 2018bcc had a rise time to peak of
        the LC of 5.6$_{{\ensuremath{-}}0.1}$$^{+0.2}$ days in the
        restframe with a rising shape power-law index close to 2, and
        seems to be a typical rapidly evolving Type Ibn SN. The spectrum
        lacked signatures of SN-like ejecta and was dominated by over 15
        He emission features at 20 days past peak, alongside Ca and Mg,
        all with V$_{FWHM}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2000 km
        s$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$. The luminous and rapidly evolving LC
        could be powered by CSM interaction but not by the decay of
        radioactive $^{56}$Ni. Modeling of the He I lines indicated a
        dense and optically thick CSM that can explain the P-Cygni
        profiles. \textbackslash Conclusions: Like other rapidly
        evolving Type Ibn SNe, SN 2018bcc is a luminous transient with a
        rapid rise to peak powered by shock interaction inside a dense
        and He-rich CSM. Its spectra do not support the existence of two
        Type Ibn spectral classes. We also note the remarkable
        observational match to pulsational pair instability SN models.}",

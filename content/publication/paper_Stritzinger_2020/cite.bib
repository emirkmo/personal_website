     abstract = "{Supernova LSQ13abf was discovered soon after explosion by the La Silla-
        QUEST Survey and then followed by the Carnegie Supernova Project
        II at its optical and near-IR wavelengths. Our analysis
        indicates that LSQ13abf was discovered within two days of
        explosion and its first {\ensuremath{\approx}}10 days of
        evolution reveal a B-band light curve with an abrupt drop in
        luminosity. Contemporaneously, the V-band light curve exhibits a
        rise towards a first peak and the r- and i-band light curves
        show no early peak. The early light-curve evolution of LSQ13abf
        is reminiscent of the post-explosion cooling phase observed in
        the Type Ib SN 2008D, and the similarity between the two objects
        extends over weeks. Spectroscopically, LSQ13abf also resembles
        SN 2008D, with P Cygni He I features that strengthen over
        several weeks. Spectral energy distributions are constructed
        from the broad-bandphotometry, a UVOIR light curve is
        constructed by fitting black-body (BB) functions, and the
        underlying BB-temperature and BB-radius profiles are estimated.
        Explosion parameters are estimated by simultaneously fitting an
        Arnett model to the UVOIR light curve and the velocity evolution
        derived from spectral features, and an in addition to a post-
        shock breakout cooling model to the first two epochs of the
        bolometric evolution. This combined model suggests an explosion
        energy of 1.27 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.23 {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$
        ergs, in addition to a relatively high ejecta mass of 5.94
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.10 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, a $^{56}$Ni
        mass of 0.16 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.02 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$,
        and a progenitor-star radius of 28.0 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 7.5
        R$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. The ejecta mass suggests the origins
        of LSQ13abf lie with a > 25 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ zero-age-
        main-sequence mass progenitor and its estimated radius is three
        times larger compared to the result obtained from the same
        analysis applied to observations of SN 2008D, and nine times
        larger compared to SN 1999ex. Alternatively, a comparison of
        hydrodynamical simulations of {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}20-25
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ zero-age-main-sequence progenitors
        that evolve to pre-supernova envelope masses of
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}10 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ and
        extended ({\ensuremath{\sim}}100 R$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$)
        envelopes also broadly match the observations of LSQ13abf.

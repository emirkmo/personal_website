     abstract = "{We performed a wide-area (2000 deg$^{2}$) g and I band experiment as
        part of a two month extension to the Intermediate Palomar
        Transient Factory. We discovered 36 extragalactic transients
        including iPTF17lf, a highly reddened local SN Ia, iPTF17bkj, a
        new member of the rare class of transitional Ibn/IIn supernovae,
        and iPTF17be, a candidate luminous blue variable outburst. We do
        not detect any luminous red novae and place an upper limit on
        their rate. We show that adding a slow-cadence I band component
        to upcoming surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility will
        improve the photometric selection of cool and dusty transients.}",

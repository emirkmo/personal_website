     abstract = "{We present a new method to photometrically delineate between various
        sub-types of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Using the color-
        stretch parameters, s$_{BV}$ or s$_{gr}$, and the time of I-band
        primary maximum relative to the B-band ( ${t}_{\max }^{I-B}$ )
        or g-band ( ${t}_{\max }^{I-g}$ ) maximum it is demonstrated
        that 2003fg-like, 1991bg-like, and 2002cx-like SNe Ia can be
        identified readily. In the cases of these extreme SNe Ia, their
        primary I-band maximum occurs after the time of the B- or g-band
        maxima. We suggest that the timing of the I-band maximum can
        reveal the physical state of the SN Ia explosion as it traces:
        (I) the speed of the recombination front of iron group elements
        in the ejecta, (II) the temperature evolution and rate of
        adiabatic cooling in the ejecta and, (III) the presence of
        interaction with a stellar envelope. This photometric sub-typing
        can be used in conjunction with other SNe analysis, such as the
        Branch diagram, to examine the physics and diversity of SNe Ia.
        The results here can also be used to screen out non-Ia SNe from
        cosmological samples that do not have complete spectroscopic
        typing. Finally, as future surveys like that of the Vera C.
        Rubin Observatory (previously referred to as the Large Synoptic
        Survey Telescope) create large databases of light curves of many
        objects this photometric identification can be used to readily
        identify and study the rates and bulk properties of peculiar SNe
        Ia.}",

     abstract = "{We report the detailed history of spin-period changes in five
        intermediate polars (DQ Herculis, AO Piscium, FO Aquarii, V1223
        Sagittarii, and BG Canis Minoris) during the 30-60 yr since
        their original discovery. Most are slowly spinning up, although
        there are sometimes years-long episodes of spin-down. This is
        supportive of the idea that the underlying magnetic white dwarfs
        are near spin equilibrium. In addition to the
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}40 stars sharing many properties and defined
        by their strong, pulsed X-ray emission, there are a few rotating
        much faster (P < 80 s), whose membership in the class is still
        in doubt{\textemdash}and who are overdue for closer study.}",

     abstract = "{Time-series photometry on the cataclysmic variable V455 Andromedae
        (hereafter V455 And, HS 2331+3905) reveals a rotation period
        shorter than the orbital period, implying the presence of a
        magnetic field. We expect that this magnetic field channels the
        accreted matter from the disk toward the white dwarf poles,
        classifying it as an Intermediate Polar. The two polar spinning
        emission areas are visible in the lightcurves at the rotation
        period of 67.61970396 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.00000072 s, and its
        harmonic. Using photometric observations of V455 And obtained
        from 2007 October to 2015, we derive 3{\ensuremath{\sigma}}
        upper limits to the rate of change of the spin harmonic (SH)
        with time to be dP$_{SH}$/dt {\ensuremath{\leq}} -7.5
        {\texttimes} 10$^{-15}$ s s$^{-1}$ employing the O-C method, and
        -5.4 {\texttimes} 10$^{-15}$ s s$^{-1}$ with a direct nonlinear
        least squares fit. There is no significant detection of a
        changing spin period for the duration of 2007 October-2015. The
        3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} upper limit for the rate of change of
        spin period with time is dP$_{spin}$/dt {\ensuremath{\leq}}
        -10.8 {\texttimes} 10$^{-15}$ s s$^{-1}$ or -0.34
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}s yr$^{-1}$. V455 And underwent a large-
        amplitude dwarf nova outburst in 2007 September. The pre-
        outburst data reflect a period 4.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2.2
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}s longer than the best-fit post-outburst spin
        period. The angular momentum gained by the white dwarf from
        matter accreted during outburst and its slight subsequent
        shrinking should both cause the star to spin slightly faster
        after the outburst. We estimate that the change in spin period
        due to the outburst should be 5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}s, consistent
        with the empirical determination of 4.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2.2
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}s (3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} upper limit of 11.4
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}s).}",

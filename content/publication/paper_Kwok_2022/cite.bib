     abstract = "{We present JWST near- and mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of the
        nearby normal Type Ia supernova SN 2021aefx in the nebular phase
        at $+255$ days past maximum light. Our Near Infrared
        Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI)
        observations, combined with ground-based optical data from the
        South African Large Telescope (SALT), constitute the first
        complete optical $+$ NIR $+$ MIR nebular SN Ia spectrum covering
        0.3$-$14 $\mu$m. This spectrum unveils the previously unobserved
        2.5$-$5 $\mu$m region, revealing strong nebular iron and stable
        nickel emission, indicative of high-density burning that can
        constrain the progenitor mass. The data show a significant
        improvement in sensitivity and resolution compared to previous
        Spitzer MIR data. We identify numerous NIR and MIR nebular
        emission lines from iron-group elements and as well as lines
        from the intermediate-mass element argon. The argon lines extend
        to higher velocities than the iron-group elements, suggesting
        stratified ejecta that are a hallmark of delayed-detonation or
        double-detonation SN Ia models. We present fits to simple
        geometric line profiles to features beyond 1.2 $\mu$m and find
        that most lines are consistent with Gaussian or spherical
        emission distributions, while the [Ar III] 8.99 $\mu$m line has
        a distinctively flat-topped profile indicating a thick spherical
        shell of emission. Using our line profile fits, we investigate
        the emissivity structure of SN 2021aefx and measure kinematic
        properties. Continued observations of SN 2021aefx and other SNe
        Ia with JWST will be transformative to the study of SN Ia
        composition, ionization structure, density, and temperature, and
        will provide important constraints on SN Ia progenitor and
        explosion models.}",

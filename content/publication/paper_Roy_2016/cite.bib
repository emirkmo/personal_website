     abstract = "{Context. Research on supernovae (SNe) over the past decade has confirmed
        that there is a distinct class of events which are much more
        luminous (by 2 mag) than canonical core-collapse SNe (CCSNe).
        These events with visual peak magnitudes
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}-21 are called superluminous SNe (SLSNe).
        The mechanism that powers the light curves of SLSNe is still not
        well understood. The proposed scenarios are circumstellar
        interaction, the emergence of a magnetar after core collapse, or
        disruption of a massive star through pair production.
        \textbackslash Aims: There are a few intermediate events which
        have luminosities between these two classes. They are important
        for constraining the nature of the progenitors of these two
        different populations and their environments and powering
        mechanisms. Here we study one such object, SN 2012aa.
        \textbackslash Methods: We observed and analysed the evolution
        of the luminous Type Ic SN 2012aa. The event was discovered by
        the Lick Observatory Supernova Search in an anonymous galaxy (z
        {\ensuremath{\approx}} 0.08). The optical photometric and
        spectroscopic follow-up observations were conducted over a time
        span of about 120 days. \textbackslash Results: With an absolute
        V-band peak of - 20 mag, the SN is an intermediate-luminosity
        transient between regular SNe Ibc and SLSNe. SN 2012aa also
        exhibits an unusual secondary bump after the maximum in its
        light curve. For SN 2012aa, we interpret this as a manifestation
        of SN-shock interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). If
        we assume a $^{56}$Ni-powered ejecta, the quasi-bolometric light
        curve requires roughly 1.3 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ of
        $^{56}$Ni and an ejected mass of 14M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$.
        This also implies a high kinetic energy of the explosion, 5.4
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$ erg. On the other hand, the unusually
        broad light curve along with the secondary peak indicate the
        possibility of interaction with CSM. The third alternative is
        the presence of a central engine releasing spin energy that
        eventually powers the light curve over a long time. The host of
        SN 2012aa is a star-forming Sa/Sb/Sbc galaxy. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: Although the spectral properties of SN 2012aa and
        its velocity evolution are comparable to those of normal SNe
        Ibc, its broad light curve along with a large peak luminosity
        distinguish it from canonical CCSNe, suggesting that the event
        is an intermediate-luminosity transient between CCSNe and SLSNe
        at least in terms of peak luminosity. In comparison to other
        SNe, we argue that SN 2012aa belongs to a subclass where CSM
        interaction plays a significant role in powering the SN, at
        least during the initial stages of evolution.}",

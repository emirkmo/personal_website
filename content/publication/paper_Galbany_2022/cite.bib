     abstract = "{We present a measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) using type Ia
        supernova (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) from the recently
        updated sample of SNe Ia in nearby galaxies with distances
        measured via Cepheid period-luminosity relations by the SHOES
        project. We collect public near-infrared photometry of up to 19
        calibrator SNe Ia and further 57 SNe Ia in the Hubble flow
        ($z>0.01$), and directly measure their peak magnitudes in the
        $J$ and $H$ band by Gaussian processes and spline interpolation.
        Calibrator peak magnitudes together with Cepheid-based distances
        are used to estimate the average absolute magnitude in each
        band, while Hubble-flow SNe are used to constrain the zero-point
        intercept of the magnitude-redshift relation. Our baseline
        result of $H_0$ is $72.3\pm1.4$ (stat) $\pm1.4$ (syst) km
        s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $J$ band and $72.3\pm1.3$ (stat)
        $\pm1.4$ (syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $H$ band, where
        the systematic uncertainties include the standard deviation of
        up to 21 variations of the analysis, the 0.7\textbackslash\%
        distance scale systematic from SHOES Cepheid anchors, a
        photometric zeropoint systematic, and a cosmic variance
        systematic. Our final measurement represents a measurement with
        a precision of 2.8\textbackslash\% in both bands. The variant
        with the largest change in $H_0$ is when limiting the sample to
        SNe from CSP and CfA programmes, noteworthy because these are
        the best calibrated, yielding $H_0\sim75$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$
        in both bands. We demonstrate stretch and reddening corrections
        are still useful in the NIR to standardize SN Ia NIR peak
        magnitudes. Based on our results, in order to improve the
        precision of the $H_0$ measurement with SNe Ia in the NIR in the
        future, we would need to increase the number of calibrator SNe
        Ia, be able to extend the Hubble-Lema{\^\i}tre diagram to
        higher-z, and include standardization procedures to help
        reducing the NIR intrinsic scatter.}",

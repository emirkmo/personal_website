     abstract = "{We present photometric and spectroscopic data on three extragalactic
        luminous red novae (LRNe): AT2018bwo, AT2021afy, and A2021blu.
        AT2018bwo was discovered in NGC45 (at about 6.8 Mpc) a few weeks
        after the outburst onset. During the monitoring period, the
        transient reached a peak luminosity of 10\^40 erg/s. AT2021afy,
        hosted by UGC10043 (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde49.2 Mpc),
        showed a double-peaked light curve, with an early maximum
        reaching a luminosity of 2.1x10\^41 erg/s. Finally, for
        AT2021blu in UGC5829 (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde8.6 Mpc),
        the pre-outburst phase was well-monitored by several photometric
        surveys, and the object showed a slow luminosity rise before the
        outburst. The light curve of AT2021blu was sampled with an
        unprecedented cadence until the object disappeared behind the
        Sun, and was then recovered at late phases. The light curve of
        LRN AT2021blu shows a double peak, with a prominent early
        maximum reaching a luminosity of 6.5x10\^40 erg/s, half that of
        AT2021afy. The spectra of AT2021afy and AT 2021blu display the
        expected evolution for LRNe: a blue continuum dominated by
        prominent Balmer lines in emission during the first peak, and a
        redder continuum consistent with that of a K-type star with
        narrow absorption metal lines during the second, broad maximum.
        The spectra of AT2018bwo are markedly different, with a very red
        continuum dominated by broad molecular features in absorption.
        As these spectra closely resemble those of LRNe after the second
        peak, probably AT 2018bwo was discovered at the very late
        evolutionary stages. This would explain its fast evolution and
        the spectral properties compatible with that of an M-type star.
        From the analysis of deep frames of the LRN sites years before
        the outburst, and considerations of the light curves, the
        quiescent progenitor systems of the three LRNe were likely
        massive, with primaries ranging from about 13Mo for AT2018bwo,
        to 13-18Mo for AT 2021blu, and over 40Mo for AT2021afy.}",

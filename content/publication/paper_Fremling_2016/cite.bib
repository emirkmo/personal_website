     abstract = "{Context. We investigate two stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe)
        discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 5806 by the (intermediate)
        Palomar Transient Factory [(I)PTF]. These SNe, designated
        PTF12os/SN 2012P and iPTF13bvn, exploded within
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde520 days of one another at a
        similar distance from the host-galaxy center. We classify
        PTF12os as a Type IIb SN based on our spectral sequence;
        iPTF13bvn has previously been classified as Type Ib having a
        likely progenitor with zero age main sequence (ZAMS) mass below
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde17 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$.
        Because of the shared and nearby host, we are presented with a
        unique opportunity to compare these two SNe. \textbackslash
        Aims: Our main objective is to constrain the explosion
        parameters of iPTF12os and iPTF13bvn, and to put constraints on
        the SN progenitors. We also aim to spatially map the metallicity
        in the host galaxy, and to investigate the presence of hydrogen
        in early-time spectra of both SNe. \textbackslash Methods: We
        present comprehensive datasets collected on PTF12os and
        iPTF13bvn, and introduce a new automatic reference-subtraction
        photometry pipeline (FPipe) currently in use by the iPTF. We
        perform a detailed study of the light curves (LCs) and spectral
        evolution of the SNe. The bolometric LCs are modeled using the
        hydrodynamical code hyde. We analyze early spectra of both SNe
        to investigate the presence of hydrogen; for iPTF13bvn we also
        investigate the regions of the Paschen lines in infrared
        spectra. We perform spectral line analysis of helium and iron
        lines to map the ejecta structure of both SNe. We use nebular
        models and late-time spectroscopy to constrain the ZAMS mass of
        the progenitors. We also perform image registration of ground-
        based images of PTF12os to archival HST images of NGC 5806 to
        identify a potential progenitor candidate. \textbackslash
        Results: We find that our nebular spectroscopy of iPTF13bvn
        remains consistent with a low-mass progenitor, likely having a
        ZAMS mass of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde12M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$.
        Our late-time spectroscopy of PTF12os is consistent with a ZAMS
        mass of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde15M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. We
        successfully identify a source in pre-explosion HST images
        coincident with PTF12os. The colors and absolute magnitude of
        this object are consistent between pre-explosion and late-time
        HST images, implying it is a cluster of massive stars. Our
        hydrodynamical modeling suggests that the progenitor of PTF12os
        had a compact He core with a mass of 3.25$^{+
        0.77}$$_{-0.56}$M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ at the time of the
        explosion, which had a total kinetic energy of 0.54$^{+
        0.41}$$_{-0.25}$ {\texttimes} {}10$^{51}$ erg and synthesized
        0.063$^{+ 0.020}$$_{-0.011}$M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ of
        strongly mixed $^{56}$Ni. Spectral comparisons to the Type IIb
        SN 2011dh indicate that the progenitor of PTF12os was surrounded
        by a thin hydrogen envelope with a mass lower than
        0.02M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. We also find tentative evidence
        that the progenitor of iPTF13bvn could have been surrounded by a
        small amount of hydrogen prior to the explosion. This result is
        supported by possible weak signals of hydrogen in both optical
        and infrared spectra. \textbackslash\textbackslashTables 3-6 are

     abstract = "{The Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) LSQ14fmg exhibits exaggerated properties
        that may help to reveal the origin of the ``super-
        Chandrasekhar'' (or 03fg-like) group. The optical spectrum is
        typical of a 03fg-like SN Ia, but the light curves are unlike
        those of any SNe Ia observed. The light curves of LSQ14fmg rise
        extremely slowly. At -23 rest-frame days relative to B-band
        maximum, LSQ14fmg is already brighter than ${M}_{V}=-19$ mag
        before host extinction correction. The observed color curves
        show a flat evolution from the earliest observation to
        approximately 1 week after maximum. The near-infrared light
        curves peak brighter than -20.5 mag in the J and H bands, far
        more luminous than any 03fg-like SNe Ia with near-infrared
        observations. At 1 month past maximum, the optical light curves
        decline rapidly. The early, slow rise and flat color evolution
        are interpreted to result from an additional excess flux from a
        power source other than the radioactive decay of the synthesized
        $^{56}$Ni. The excess flux matches the interaction with a
        typical superwind of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star in
        density structure, mass-loss rate, and duration. The rapid
        decline starting at around 1 month past B-band maximum may be an
        indication of rapid cooling by active carbon monoxide (CO)
        formation, which requires a low-temperature and high-density
        environment. These peculiarities point to an AGB progenitor near
        the end of its evolution and the core degenerate scenario as the
        likely explosion mechanism for LSQ14fmg. $^{*}$ This paper

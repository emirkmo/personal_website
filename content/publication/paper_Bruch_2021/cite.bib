     abstract = "{Spectroscopic detection of narrow emission lines traces the presence of
        circumstellar mass distributions around massive stars exploding
        as core-collapse supernovae. Transient emission lines
        disappearing shortly after the supernova explosion suggest that
        the material spatial extent is compact and implies an increased
        mass loss shortly prior to explosion. Here, we present a
        systematic survey for such transient emission lines (Flash
        Spectroscopy) among Type II supernovae detected in the first
        year of the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. We find that at
        least six out of ten events for which a spectrum was obtained
        within two days of the estimated explosion time show evidence
        for such transient flash lines. Our measured flash event
        fraction (>30\% at 95\% confidence level) indicates that
        elevated mass loss is a common process occurring in massive
        stars that are about to explode as supernovae.}",

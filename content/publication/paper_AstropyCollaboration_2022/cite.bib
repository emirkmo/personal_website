     abstract = "{The Astropy Project supports and fosters the development of open-source
        and openly developed Python packages that provide commonly
        needed functionality to the astronomical community. A key
        element of the Astropy Project is the core package astropy,
        which serves as the foundation for more specialized projects and
        packages. In this article, we summarize key features in the core
        package as of the recent major release, version 5.0, and provide
        major updates on the Project. We then discuss supporting a
        broader ecosystem of interoperable packages, including
        connections with several astronomical observatories and
        missions. We also revisit the future outlook of the Astropy
        Project and the current status of Learn Astropy. We conclude by
        raising and discussing the current and future challenges facing
        the Project.}",
